A consideration of various errors Quine advanced in his theory of langauge and
epistemology.

Those who are already familiar with Quine's views on langauge and reason may
find this a useful way to understand the version of [[semantic_holism_trail]] proposed
in these notes, as it is a close descendant of Quine's views.

== introduction ==
= This work would not have been possible without Quine's account of semantic
holism.
It is easy to carp at minor flaws in any philosophical work.

The extraordinary self-confidence to follow his insight.
No matter how well established their philosophical pedigree or the gains made by
being engaging with extraordinary philsoophers such as Carnap, ?????. The
willingness to follow even to doubting , a doctrine that is so deeply counter
intuitive that many still find it when no-one else agreees with you can never be
taken away form quine.
But first discoverers rarely even correctly grasp the scope and nature of their
newly discovered continent. New discoveres rarely present their discoveries in
tyhe simplest form. Descarets never thought to put the axes of his cartesian
plane at right angles. (Instead he devised a pair of axes at whatever angle
facilitated a proof concerning a paricular family of curves he was interested
in.) Reports from new lands are seldom reliable, and their being 

Like many discoverers and
pioneers he still had one foot in the old paradigm and does not 

= Finally it may simply that Quine defined the term. That any disoute qill
inevtitably simply reflect a different sense of the term. There is Quine's
= in what sense errors
At the outset it may seem foolish to claim that Quine's account of semantic
holism was mistaken. After all he may be viewed as  defining the term
<q>semanrtic holism</q>. If, for
instance, Quine claims that in a semantically holistic language((i.e. a language of which semantic holism is true))
<q>Any sentence may be held true ...</q>??-find source Two Dogmas? -??
then by definition (as it were) any language in which  some statements may not
be held true (perhaps without breach of some linguistic propriety, or on pain of
being judged as an incompetent speaker by ones linguistic peers, or without
ceasing to speak that language) come what may is not a semantically holistic
language.

But Quine makes another equally important claim, which is that semantic holsim
is supposed to be a consequence of the failure of reductionism. Because of the
reasons contemplated in Carnap's _Aufbau der Welt_ . It is those langauges, and
quite simply, many of the claims QUine makes about such languages do not follow
from confirmation holism, they do not follow from a failure of reductionism

That in other words semantic holism is supposed to be a consequence of
confirmation holism, as outlined by Carnap in _der Aufbau_, the inanility
Or to put it in terms of epistemic bottlenecks semantic holsim is supposed to
??be a consequence of the claim that
?/follow from the fact that
statements about the objects on the far
side of an epistemic bottleneck cannot be <q>reduced</q> to statements refering
solely to objects _in_ that bottleneck.
there is related assumption that Quine does appear to make in connection here,
viz that a statement and its reduction (which by stipulation have the same
con/infirmation conditions) have the same meaning. (And hence sentences that
have no such reduction do not have individual meanings. 
That direct arguemnt does rely upon verificationism, ??- MAYBE and we will have
no truck with it here. -?? . For the moment however, we are without that further
claim. We are interested in what follows from confirmation holism (i.e. that
statements about the objects on the far side of a (discernable) epistemic
bottleneck) _without_ assuming verificationism.Statements cannot be reduced
without assuming that sentences and their reductions have the same meaning, or
that irreducible sentences have no meanings .





Quine made a series of errors in his account of holism, perhaps the most
pernicious of which was his reliance upon reductive behaviourism to dismiss the
intentional idioms (attributions of beliefs

perhaps the worst thing QUine did for holism, however, is that in addition

= sequence =

1. [[observation_sentences]]
   There are two problems with observation sentences as Quine defines them in
   _Word and Object_.
   * The first concerns the connection between observation sentences and stimuli
	 (or objects in whichever [[epistemic_bottleneck]] is under consideration)
	 which is more diffuse than Quine claims.<br>
	 [[penumbral_confirmation_conditions]]
   * The second problem is one that Quine appears to recognised and struggled
	 with throughout his later his career - intersubjective identity no two
	 peoples bodies are shaped the same nor sensory nerves placed in the same
	 positions
2. any statement held true come what may
3. holistic languages do not contain analytic truths`
4. intersubjective identification of stimuli
5. observation sentences
   

no sharp distinction

but Quine's greatest error was to reject intensionality altogether. This

quines rejection of intensionality
    - if i were here attempting to give a physicalistic reduction of intensional
      terms then the reliance upon expectations. But here I am giving an account
      of how, a system which did have expectations of its inputs/stimuli could
      come to have belief states best explined/theorised (????ugly) by the
      positiing of intensional objects
      
      note also that I am not taking expectations about the objects on
      the far side of the relevant bottle neck. if we took the matter of
      expected course of evidence as epsitemically accessible to us.
      
      We have assumed that our access to the epistemic bottleneck is
      uninteresting, and that remains unchanged, but our interest is not solely
      in the relationships between evidence and states evidenced for. we are
      as interested in the representations on this side  of the objects on the far side of the
      epistemic bottleneck
      
      and the extent to which we our beliefs concerning the objects opn the far
      side of the bottleneck may be justified. And what the relata of that
      relationship are.

== other disagreements ==
=== are explicitly logical truths analytic ===
response to _Carnap and Logical Truth_ and _Truth by Convention_

One part of the problem is the reliance upon synonymy between non-logical and
logical truths. This is the chief attack in _Two Dogmas_.

If the notion of synonymy is not epistemically accessible, then we cannot get
the second, larger class of analytic truths.

In _Carnap and Logical Truth_ Quine focuses on the logical truths themselves.
Does the claim that they are <q>true by virtue of meaning</q> or (not quite
equivalent) must (***1) be held true by competent speakers or must be translated
as true the doctrine that straight out explicit logical truths are analytic is
now in question.

Let us reflect on the various impediments to accounting for these truths as
<q>true by virtue of meaning alone</q>.

Even Quine admits there are inferential roles, they are part of the data the
radical translator has access to, it is just that they are not enough to
preclude the indeterminacy of translation (or what amounts to the same, to fix
the meanings of the sentences that are connected by those inferential roles.

The class of sentences that all comptent speakers do, in fact, hold true is
discernable. As is the class of sentences they would hold true as a result of
any reasonably short stimulation/course of events. There are patterns in the
senteces they hold true. They never hold true and sentence of the form 'p or q'
with also holding ' not p' or 'not q'.

So there are the inferences, in this case meaning nothing more than reliable
patterns of assent and dissent to sentences among all competent speakers once
their attention is drawn to such sentences, and bearing in mind the limitations
of attention and cognitive power (i.e. judgeing a long and convoluted logical
truth to be false does not disqualify a suggesated translation since it can be
attributed to speaker error. We may need to assume, at least to start with, that
all the speakers of the relevant community are competent, but we do not require
them to be incapable of logical error.)

(***1) what is the force of this must? Must be held true by competent speakers
on pain of not being competent?  But all the traslator can determine is which
sentences *are* held true by putative competent speakers.

That there is a casual mechanism underlying these inferential patterns is almost
unavoidable.

Isn't this mere obviousness again, isn't a translation which renders some
foreign speaker as dissenting from <q>Water is wet</q> just as unacceptable as
one which 


we can rely upon these patterns in formulating translations

when pressed perhaps people (certainly me) think there is a range of possible
histories, a person learning the langauge under a range of other possible world
worlds learning the same langauge (yes this means in all of them water is H2O if
you think that part of the meaning of water) but we cant turn around any rely
upon a notion of possible world here from which we can construct analytic.

But is this really a second problem. Suppose we had solved the synonymy problem.
That for rach senternce we cold identify the class of synoymous sentences and to
nearly all effects treat that as the meaning of those sentences. trasnaltion was
determinate between these classes etc.,

could we now say that the meaning of a logical compound sentence (A and B)
(A or B) is compounded from the meanings of those sentences.

now could we identify inferences between these classes.

why pick out logical terms - proof procedure
It is contingent in a sense that this level of complexity is required. The world
oculd be at a different level of complexity as could our minds

because if I did not hold tnhese my assents would not be held together by as
proof procedure.
I must be able to derive my assertions from a set of axioms - this is the only
way I could do it. This will require something equivalent to first order logic.

one way tpo above idea - consider the most logically detailed of all the members
of a synonym class. if we deleted that one there would be some inferences we
could not capture.

==== self evident ====
<q>There are words</q> is also self-evident but we would hesitate to call it
analytic.

We make a mechanism which respects semantic properties. Those patterns are built
into the machine. Those other patterns are due to the inputs. We only get
certain inputs into the machine - so regularities in its outputs cannot be
attributed to just one of these factors.



????- quote descartes rules for direction
whenever they have the luck to discover something certain and evident, they
always present it wrapped up in various 367 obscurities, either because they
fear that the simplicity of their argument may depreciate the importance of
their finding, or because they begrudge ' us the plain truth.
