== Wretched science, after taking from us your valid inferences, do you overthrow us? Our fall will be your defeat! ==
If it were only a question of providing foundations for philosophy, the conflict
between our scientific theories and our understanding of ourselves as reasoning
beings might be resolved (as popular scientists such as
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&oldid=1194043681#Philosophy|Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-consolation-of-philos/|Lawrence Krauss]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hawking&oldid=1193926342#Philosophy_is_unnecessary|Stephen Hawking]]
have suggested) by simply dismissing philosophy as a source of knowledge
altogether. However, the lack of foundations for philosophy is only one aspect
of the more general problem. The lack of an account of reasoning compatible with
our scientific theories is particularly salient in philosophy because, at least
until recently in the Anglo-European tradition, philosophy was thought of as a
field in which knowledge was pursued _by reason alone_ (i.e. unaided by the
senses((Except, perhaps, for the initial acquisition of the relevant concepts as per the traditional view described [[#second problem: the content of scientific theories|above]] ))&zwj;).  However, even if that demarcation of philosophy is useful,
reason is not the exclusive prerogative of philosophers. People exercise their
capacity to reason in other fields and daily life, and their capacity to do
so is no less puzzling (and perhaps considerably more productive of knowledge)
than that of philosophers((Indeed one of the puzzles concerning our ability to reason is how reasoning could be so successful in producing knowledge in fields such as mathematics, science and ordinary life and yet so unproductive of knowledge in philosophy.)).

In particular, as many philosophers have noted, scientific theories themselves
rely upon reasoning for their justification. The relationship between science
and philosophy is not like that between modern chemistry and alchemy. Medieval
alchemists may have possessed some knowledge of chemical properties and
reactions buried amongst their superstitions and esoteric theories, but alchemy
has been altogether superseded by chemistry. The methods and principles of
alchemy have been either rejected or justified by means entirely within the
field of chemistry, leaving no residual core of alchemical principles which
modern chemistry relies upon but cannot justify. By contrast, modern science
appears to be unavoidably reliant upon necessary principles in which belief is
justified by much the same means as those by which ancient philosophers
justified their beliefs in the truths of geometry. Not only do scientific
theories contain mathematical claims, but the relationship between scientific
theories and the evidence that supports them appears to involve necessary truths
that are not themselves known through scientific investigation. Whether a
scientific principle or theory is supported by a given range of evidence seems,
ultimately, to be a necessary truth that is not itself discoverable by empirical
scientific investigation (though scientific investigation may reveal whether
that evidence happens to exist). In both these ways, our knowledge of necessary
truths appears to remain indispensable to the justification of scientific
theories and yet apparently unjustifiable by scientific methods.

A conclusion some philosophers have drawn from the apparent dependence of
science upon unscientific knowledge of valid inferences and necessary truths, is
that science can never undermine reason as a source of knowledge of necessary
truths without undermining itself. If, on their view, no being capable of
discerning necessary truths can be constructed from the materials postulated in
our best scientific theories, then that only shows that the scientific image of
the world is partial (and perhaps some aspects of reality are beyond the reach
of scientific discovery altogether). Indeed some philosophers who are attracted
to this line of reasoning have dubbed the view that no aspect of reality is
beyond scientific discovery [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientism&oldid=1193255716|<q>Scientism</q>]], and decry such Scientism as one
of the great intellectual errors of the current age (see external link).

It is easy to see why this line of reasoning might appeal to philosophers. It
neatly defends the continued relevance and value of philosophical enquiries to
successful knowledge production in the sciences and tacitly establishes
philosophy as the queen of the sciences. Attributing to it the responsibility of
establishing necessary principles upon which scientific theories depend.
However, the claim that science is partial leaves the conflict between our
scientific understanding of the world and our understanding of ourselves as
reasoning beings unresolved; for it does not explain how our capacity to gain
knowledge of necessary truths can affect aspects of reality (such as our bodily
movements) of which knowledge can be gained by scientific means and yet remain
beyond scientific discovery itself. Worse yet, the conclusion that if scientific
theories are incompatible with our having the capacity to gain knowledge of
necessary truths then we could not know those theories to be true is only
reached by taking key elements of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning for granted.

=== knowledge of scientific theories not dependent upon knowledge of necessary truths ===
Many, perhaps all, scientific theories contain mathematical and logical truths((Statements that are true under all interpretations of their non-logical or non-mathematical terms)).
Statements which, at least by the lights of the traditional account of knowledge
and reasoning, are true necessarily. Furthermore, those mathematical and logical
statements are often indispensable to those theories. No alternative theory that
does not contain those statements (or translations of them) captures the same
observable predictions as consequences. In this sense it is true that scientific
theories are dependent on putative necessary truths.

By and large, however, scientific theories do not contain ascriptions of
necessity (or possibility). Theories such as such as Newtonian mechanics,
general relativity and atomic theory, for instance, contain statements asserting
that multiplication is commutative; but they do not contain statements asserting
that multiplication is _necessarily_ commutative. Scientific theories contain
statements that may be rendered into the clear notation of modal logic as:
    {{local:docs/zz.images/multiplicationCommutative.png}}
but they do not contain explicit ascriptions of necessity such as:
    {{local:docs/zz.images/multiplicationNecessarilyCommutative.png}}
Furthermore, there is a _prima facie_ plausible explanation for this lack.
Scientific theories are in the business of explaining, or at least predicting,
our observations. Although the details are still disputed, it is the success of
scientific theories in predicting our observations that justifies belief in the
statements they contain. (Though this is not to assume we could not be justified
in believing some of those statements on other grounds.) What happens in other
possible worlds, to borrow the language of modal realists such as David
Lewis, is irrelevant to our observations in this real world. For the purpose of
predicting our observations it matters not one whit whether multiplication is
commutative in other possible worlds so long as it is commutative in this world.
(Nor does it matter if the rules of inference relied upon to delineate the
statements contained in a scientific theory preserve truth in other worlds so
long as they do in this one.)

This is not to say that scientific theories _cannot_ include modal ascriptions.
That ascriptions of modality are somehow incoherent, unclear or otherwise
unsuited to <q>limning the true and ultimate structure of reality</q>(([[local:zz.texts/quine1960-wordAndObject.pdf]]&zwj;)).
If what was true in other possible worlds somehow influenced what we observed in
this real world (perhaps via people's capacity to reason and thence their
actions) then a true explanation of our observations would have to include
ascriptions of possibility and necessity, and if that were the best available
explanation of our observations then we would be justified in believing it((It may be objected that possible worlds cannot influence each other _by definition_.  That if parallel universes influence events in this one then they are not other possible worlds but only some further part of this possible world and the sort of modality they would warrant introducing into our scientific theories would not be the absolute modality of possibility and necessity. I have nothing to gainsay this objection, except to note that it only strengthens the claim currently being defended; viz., that the observations which justify belief in scientific theories concerning natural phenomena do not justify beliefs in modal ascriptions.)).
Indeed there are occasional, somewhat fevered, suggestions that such influences
occur in quantum mechanics. If evidence of such influences were discovered, the
use of modal operators in scientific theories might well be justified. Thus far,
however, no such influences from other possible worlds have been detected and no
modern scientific explanations of our observations contain such ascriptions((In recent times philosophers have paid great attention to putative _a posteriori_ necessities, such as <q>Water is necessarily H,,2,,O</q>. However, the necessity of such statements hinges upon ways in which affairs in one world _w,,0,,_ affect which other possible worlds statements made in _w,,0,,_ are true of. If such ascriptions of necessity are justified at all, it is as elements of explanations of our linguistic and cognitive capacities, and not as explanations of the observations upon which our theories of chemistry are founded. See {[[a_posteriori_necessities*]]}.)).

If (1) scientific theories contained ascriptions of necessity, (2) all the
materials postulated in scientific theories were insensitive to modal properties
and relationships, and (3) no reasoning creature capable of knowing ascriptions
of necessity to be true could be composed of purely modally insensitive
materials; _then_ it would follow that if our scientific theories were not
partial (i.e. there were not elements of reality, and more particularly elements
of the creatures who believed these theories, of a kind other than those
postulated in our scientific theories and governed by laws other than those our
scientific theories claim govern other natural phenomena) then we could not know
those theories to be true. In this sense the claim that no aspect of reality was
beyond scientific discovery would be pragmatically self-defeating; for we could
not know those theories if they were false, and if they were true then we could
not know the ascriptions of necessity that they contained. However, our current
best scientific theories do not contain such ascriptions, and it is only by
taking it for granted that we know that some of the statements contained by
scientific theories are necessarily true that the claim that science is total
is made to appear pragmatically self-defeating.

Another way in which our knowledge of scientific theories might be thought to
depend upon our knowledge of necessary truths is via their evidential support.
Though, again, the details are still disputed, our belief in scientific theories
is somehow justified by their success in predicting (and retrodicting) our
observations. Our capacity to determine those theories observable predictions,
may be thought to require us to have knowledge of necessary truths. As a modern
adherent of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning puts it:
    In setting out to confirm an inductive hypothesis, we must be able to
    recognize what its consequences would be. Ordinarily, to recognize these we
    must apply deduction; we take the hypothesis along with other things that we
    know and we see what is then implied. All of this, it would seem, involves
    apprehension of truths of reason <br>
    <br>
    These truths pertain to certain abstract or eternal objects--things such as
    properties, numbers, and propositions or states of affairs, things that
    would exist even if there weren't any contingent things such as persons and
    physical objects.<br>
    ([[chisholm1987-truths_of_reason|R. Chisholm, _Truths of Reason_, 1987]])
If our capacity to determine the observable consequences of scientific theories
were dependent upon our capacity to distinguish arguments that necessarily
preserved truth; then, again, the claim that science was total (and hence the
principles which, according to our best scientific theories, govern the
rest of the natural world also govern our behaviour and the formation of our
beliefs) would be pragmatically self-defeating. If our scientific theories were
true then we could not know them to be so. But again, this is merely a
particularly partisan way of saying that if our scientific theories preclude
sensitivity to modal properties and relationships then they are incompatible
with theories of knowledge, such as the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning, according to which such sensitivity is required for knowledge.

The reason these arguments are so widely taken as establishing that the
(non-modal) principles which, according to our best scientific theories, govern
the rest of the natural world, do not govern our actions and the formation of
our beliefs, is that elements of the traditional account of knowledge are
still deeply embedded in our((or at least the Anglo-European)) common understanding of ourselves. The
Aristotelian principle that in the best and most certain form of knowledge
(_epistêmê_ - the sort of knowledge we have of geometry, logic and mathematics)
we are aware of the thing known <q>that it is not possible for [it] to be
otherwise</q>(([[local:zz.texts/aristotle-completeWorks.oxfordRevisedTrans.pdf]], _Posterior Analytics_ Book 1 Section 2)) and that all our other knowledge is dependent on our
possession of this best form of knowledge, remains so fundamental
to folk epistemology that any questioning of this principle is easily taken as
tantamount to skepticism.

Our knowledge of scientific theories is no doubt dependent upon our ability to
reason (including, among other things, the ability to infer the logical
consequences of a theory from its axioms) but it is not dependent upon the truth
of any one particular explanation of that ability. In particular it is not
dependent upon the truth of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning.
The conflict between our scientific theories and that account of knowledge and
reasoning does not imply that we do not know those theories, but only that
_either_ we do not know those theories _or_ the traditional account of knowledge
and reasoning is wrong.

== traditional account of knowledge and reasoning a false explanation ==
Attentive readers may have wondered at the caveat in the claim of the last
section that _by and large_ scientific theories do not contain ascriptions of
necessity. The reason for this reservation is that on the view 
advocated here, the traditional account of reasoning is itself, if not a
scientific theory((The most commonly given reason for denying that the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning is best understood as an scientific theory is that it is inextricably bound up with normative judgements. Of course, normative judgements may be made about the states postulated in explanatory theories. Belief-desire psychology is an explanatory theory concerning psychological states which gains credence from its success in predicting people's actions, but for all that some desires may be held to be improper. But in the case of theories of knowledge it is often claimed that there is a closer connection to normative judgements.)), at least like a scientific theory in being a theory in
which belief is justified by its success in predicting and explaining our
observations.

The chief purpose of this work is to argue that the traditional account of
knowledge and reasoning is simply a false explanation of our capacity to reason,
and, in particular, the claim that there are two types of truths, necessary and
contingent, is simply a further false element of this explanation.
(Much as the distinction between phlogistinated and dephlogistinated materials
is part of a false explanation of combustion.) Against a background of changing
and unpredictable circumstances, the salient success of geometrical proofs in
reliably producing apparently true beliefs concerning the measurable spatial
properties and relationships of physical objects, prompted ancient Greek
philosophers to attempt to explain their success. The hypothesis that the truths
revealed to us by this method are necessarily true, and that we have an innate
capacity to distinguish at least some such truths, (and some patterns of
inference that necessarily preserve truth) appeared to explain a range of
phenomena. How we acquired such knowledge without empirical investigation. Why
some truths could be known in this way but not others. Why the results of these
methods were so much more reliable than beliefs justified by observation.
Another factor contributing to the spread of this explanation amongst ancient
Greek philosophers (and those influenced by them) was its consonance with the
ancient Greek mystical view that the changing world we observe is a shadowy
illusion, cast by an underlying and unchanging true reality. (A view that
lingers on in the Christian belief that the bedrock of reality is a
necessarily existing and unchanging God.)

Like the falsehood of the theory of perception upon which the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning relied; the falsehood of the claim that there
are necessary and contingent truths (and unaided reason can only justify
knowledge of the former) does not imply that we do not have knowledge or cannot
reason, but only that the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning is
wrong. However, the traditional theory of perception involved claims concerning
the processes by which the properties of external objects were transmitted to our
minds via our sensory organs. Claims which were comparatively easily
refuted by empirical investigation of the physical processes involved
in perception. By contrast, the claim that we are are capable of distinguishing
necessary truths draws its chief support from its explanation of our
introspective awareness of our own thought processes.  Its credibility is
largely due to the explanation it offers of the introspectively felt difference
between statements such as <q>All widows have been married.</q> and <q>All
widows are near the Earth.</q>. The immediacy of the introspective awareness of
a distinction between these two types of statement, and its direct connection to
the diagnosis of necessity/contingency gives this diagnosis an
unwarranted credibility. This has made this last lingering element of the
traditional account of knowledge and reasoning particularly resistant to
correction (see {[[introspection_not_a_source_of_theoretical_knowledge]]}).
However, while an alternative account of our capacity to reason does need to
explain what it is about these sentences that we are responding to, it does not
need to take the diagnosis of sensitivity to necessity/contingency at face
value, and questioning that diagnosis need not plunge us into skepticism.
