    The world with its quarks and chromosomes, its distant lands and spiral
    nebulae, is like a vast computer in a black box, forever sealed except for
    its input and output registers. These we directly observe, and in the light
    of them we speculate on the structure of the machine, the universe. Thus it
    is that we think up the quarks and chromosomes, the distant lands and the
    nebulae; they would account for the observable data. When an observation
    turns out unexpectedly, we may try modifying our theory of that structure at
    one or another point.<br>

= epistemic bottlenecks =
We know of some objects only through their effects on other objects to which we
have comparatively direct epistemic access. Stars too faint to be seen by the
naked eye, for example, are known to us only through their effects on
photographic plates, the antennae of radio telescopes and other astronomical
equipment. Let us call this kind of epistemic dependency an epistemic
bottleneck; and speak of the objects, like faint stars, which are known
only indirectly as being _on the far side_ of the relevant bottleneck, and the
objects through which they are known as being _in_ the relevant bottleneck.

== sense-data supposedly an ultimate bottleneck ==
Many philosophers, most notably empiricists such as Berkeley and Hume, but also
many non-empiricists including Aristotle, Descartes and Kant, have believed that
there is a special type of object through which all others (or at least all
other objects located in space and time) are known to us. This special class of
objects are sometimes dubbed <q>sense-data</q> or <q>sensations</q>, and many
phi

their effects on 

it is only by their effects on these sense data that we know of other objects


, and that we only know of other objects (or at least other
objects located in space and time) through their effects on these sense-data. If
there are such sense-data they constitute a kind of ultimate epistemic
bottleneck, on the far side of which were all the other objects in the world.
The claim that there are epistemic bottlenecks, however, does not commit us to
the existence of such an ultimate bottleneck nor the existence of sense data.
Even if there is no ultimate epistemic bottleneck nor ultimate evidence upon
which all our knowledge of a posteriori truths is based, and what is taken as
evidence depends on context and passing interests, there may still be
non-ultimate epistemic bottlenecks.

Although belief in sense-data is no longer as widespread as it was, it may
be worthwhile to note several other properties that have traditionally been
attributed to sense-data which are not required of the objects in epistemic
bottlenecks as that term is being defined here:

==== need not be directly observed ====
The objects in one epistemic bottleneck, may themselves be on the far side of
some other epistemic bottleneck, and known only by their effects on yet closer
objects to which our epistemic access is again _comparatively_ more direct.

In Russell's terminology the objects in an epistemic bottleneck need not be
<q>known by acquaintance</q> but may
be <q>known by description</q>. But the existence of epistemic
bottlenecks, or rather of objects in epistemic bottlenecks, does not presume on
Russell's theory of knowledge.  Indeed the existence of epistemic bottlenecks
does not imply that there are any epistemically closest objects that are known
to us by acquaintance at all.

The claim that there are epistemic bottlenecks does not preclude there being
proximal _causes_ of experience without proximal objects _of_ experience.  Our
awareness may always be of more or less distal objects((Least distal are those objects which directly impinge upon our skin or other sensory surfaces, and the firing of our sensory cells themselves. In psychological texts these are sometime described as proximal stimuli which are <q>directly perceived by our sensory receptors</q>. But of course such events are not directly perceived by _us_ and are not known to us by acquaintance.  By that rigorous standard such impingements still count as distal and there is a sense in which the firing of our sensory cells is not perceived by us at all except with the aid of special equipment (and generally in the third person). Let us avoid being drawn into just where to draw the line between proximal and distal stimuli for the time being.)). If we perceive
apples, chairs and people without there being intermediary sense-data which we
perceive directly, that does not preclude the existence of epistemic
bottlenecks.

==== known infallibly, only a simplifying assumption ====
Another special property many philosophers have attributed to sense-data
is that each of us has infallible knowledge of our own sense-data.
    Each sense has one kind of object which it discerns, and never errs in
    reporting that what is before it is colour or sound (though it may err as to
    what it is that is coloured or where that is, or what it is that is sounding
    or where that is). Such objects are what we call the special objects of this
    or that sense.
    <br>(Aristotle, [[local:zz.texts/aristotle-completeWorks.oxfordRevisedTrans.pdf|_De Anima_]], Book II, Section 6)

    the intellect can never be deceived by any experience, provided that when
    the object is presented to it, it intuits it in a fashion exactly
    corresponding to the way in which it possesses the object, either within
    itself or in the imagination.
    <br>(Descartes, [[local:zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritings.pdf|_Rules for the Direction of the Mind_]], Rule Twelve)
	
    as far as ideas((In the next paragraph Descartes explicitly includes sensations such as <q>hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire</q> among his ideas.)) are concerned, provided they are considered solely
    in themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot strictly
    speaking be false; for whether it is a goat or a chimera that I am
    imagining, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the latter. 
    <br>(Descartes, [[local:zz.texts/descartes2-philosophicalWritings.pdf|_Third Meditation_]])

    since all actions and sensations of the mind are known to us by
    consciousness, they must necessarily appear in every particular what they
    are, and be what they appear.
    <br>(Hume, [[local:zz.texts/descartes2-philosophicalWritings.pdf|_Third Meditation_]])

    It is correctly said that the senses do not err; yet not because they always
    judge correctly, but because they do not judge at all
    <br>(Kant, [[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_]], A293)

No such infallibility is attributed to our knowledge of the objects in epistemic
bottlenecks in general. However, as our main concern is with relationships
between the objects in epistemic bottlenecks and the claims
made concerning the objects on the far side, it may occasionally simplify
matters to assume (contrary to fact) that our knowledge of the objects in the
particular bottleneck in question is infallible in some places is a simplifying assumption to
consider our


it will be convenient, much of the time, to assume that we have certain
knowledge of the objects in the epistemic bottleneck

Furthermore, for our purposes we may pretend that the objects described in the
theory or statement are known with certainty, or at least without any practical
doubt for the purposes of the conversation at hand, and so we may take the
conditions of the relevant bottleneck as the only confirmation conditions of the
statement or theory in question.

==== not known completely ====
Another property
There is nothing more to sense data than what we sense of them.

There may be more to objects in an epistemic bottleneck


==== need not be either necessary or complete ====
Like sense data
Although the existence of uncircumventable , i.e. objects of which we have no
knowledge except . And they are the true epistemic bottlenecks

But there are others, such as an example that we will consider at some length,
such as the screen and keyboard of a computer. In this case we might, perhaps,
open up the case of a and measure. However, so long as we are thinking 


===== no commitment to epistemic internalism/externalism =====
not reliabilism
Thus for instance, it does not matter, 
whether our beliefs concerning the objects on the far side of an epistemic
bottleneck are justified by our beliefs about the objects in the relevant
epistemic bottleneck or by virtue of the fact that they are reliably caused by
objects in the relevant or are justified by those 

or it is the arrangements of the objects in an epistemic bottleneck themselves
which justify our beliefs
concerning the objects 

It is however precluded that there are loops of epistemic dependency. If we know
of electrons, say, partly by their influence on protons, and of protons partly
by their influence on electrons then neither is on the far side of an epistemic
bottleneck that the other is in. Either both

The only causal relationship between our beliefs and the arrangements of objects
that make those beliefs true is mediated by the objects in the relevant

Even here problems could be raised about distinguishing between input devices
and other devices. Is the capacity to induce some bit in memory to flip by
judicious application of a strong external magnet to be considered a form of
input, but if we rule out such interference, must we also rule out the state and
motion of bluetooth mice? There is no shortage of tedious philosophers who raise
such tedious issues in the name of .

In practice we do manage to distinguish between the interface. Though doing so is doubtless tied up
with our goals and which of our peers goals we regard as reasonable.

It may be that epistemic bottlenecks are some kind of ideal case of which there
are no pure instances in nature. That it is only a distinction that some objects
come close to fulfilling, or  we are prepared to pretend that some objects
come close to fulfilling for one reas

In which case the claim is simply that to the extent that the idealisation is a
useful or desirable one, the conclusions drawn about the relationships between
our knowledge of the objects of the far side of an epistemic bottleneck are
useful or will somehow aid the fulfillment of our desires.

Neither of these doctrines is required that they are both an epistemic
bottleneck through which all our information about the external world must flow
before going on to cause our beliefs, and because they are in practice the last
clear and public cause of our beliefs.



. But the views advance in this collection of notes do not rely upon the
existence of such an all encompassing epistemic bottleneck, nor of such ultimate
evidence.  But only the more humble claim that there are some epistemic
bottlenecks or other at some points in the flow of information to us from the
objects of which we have knowledge. Even if there are no clear input and output
registers, and what is taken as "ultimate evidence" depends on context and
passing interests, that is still compatible with the existence of epistemic
bottlenecks, and hence still compatible with the arguments on offer here.

== structure of our knowledge of objects in epistemic bottlenecks ==
Having described some of the ways in which our knowledge of epistemic
bottlenecks and the objects in them may fall short of the standard.

bottleneck in our knowledge of distant stars. But They provide this epistemic
bottleneck. We may not, for instance know exactly 

Here a device of semantic assent

In the next section we shall begin to make claims regarding the complexity of
the sequences of states of the objects in epistemic bottlenecks. In order for
those evaluations of the complexity of sets of sequences of states we require
there to be . Thus, rather than talking about the structure of the states of
affairs themselves, which come in such multifarious forms that they resist, and
any abstraction may be felt to include some unacknowledged assumption concerning
the nature of those. We can instead rely upon the device of semantic ascent, and
instead . What then is the required structure of the statements that we can know
to be true.

In order to get our minds clear it is useful, rather than starting with the
general structures, to begin with (comparatively) concrete examples of epistemic
bottlenecks and what we know of them.
