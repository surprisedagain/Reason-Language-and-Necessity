<blockquote>
The world with its quarks and chromosomes, its distant lands and spiral
nebulae, is like a vast computer in a black box, forever sealed except for
its input and output registers. These we directly observe, and in the light
of them we speculate on the structure of the machine, the universe. Thus it
is that we think up the quarks and chromosomes, the distant lands and the
nebulae; they would account for the observable data. When an observation
turns out unexpectedly, we may try modifying our theory of that structure at
one or another point.<br>

<p>
We know of some objects only through their effects on other objects to which we
have comparatively direct epistemic access. Stars too faint to be seen by the
naked eye, for example, are known to us only through their effects on
photographic plates, the antennae of radio telescopes and other astronomical
equipment. Let us call this kind of epistemic dependency an epistemic
bottleneck; and speak of the objects, like faint stars, which are known
only indirectly as being <em>on the far side</em> of the relevant bottleneck, and the
objects through which they are known as being <em>in</em> the relevant bottleneck.

<p>
Many philosophers, most notably empiricists such as Berkeley and Hume, but also
many non-empiricists including Aristotle, Descartes and Kant, have believed that
there is a special type of object through which all others (or at least all
other objects located in space and time) are known to us. This special class of
objects are sometimes dubbed <q>sense-data</q> or <q>sensations</q>, and many
phi

their effects on

</p>


<p>
, and that we only know of other objects (or at least other
objects located in space and time) through their effects on these sense-data. If
there are such sense-data they constitute a kind of ultimate epistemic
bottleneck, on the far side of which were all the other objects in the world.
The claim that there are epistemic bottlenecks, however, does not commit us to
the existence of such an ultimate bottleneck nor the existence of sense data.
Even if there is no ultimate epistemic bottleneck nor ultimate evidence upon
which all our knowledge of a posteriori truths is based, and what is taken as
evidence depends on context and passing interests, there may still be
non-ultimate epistemic bottlenecks.
</p>

<p>
Although belief in sense-data is no longer as widespread as it was, it may
be worthwhile to note several other properties that have traditionally been
attributed to sense-data which are not required of the objects in epistemic
bottlenecks as that term is being defined here:
</p>

<div id="epistemic bottlenecks-sense-data supposedly an ultimate bottleneck-need not be directly observed"><h4 id="need not be directly observed" class="header"><a href="#epistemic bottlenecks-sense-data supposedly an ultimate bottleneck-need not be directly observed">need not be directly observed</a></h4></div>
<p>
The objects in one epistemic bottleneck, may themselves be on the far side of
some other epistemic bottleneck, and known only by their effects on yet closer
objects to which our epistemic access is again <em>comparatively</em> more direct.
</p>

<p>
In Russell's terminology the objects in an epistemic bottleneck need not be
<q>known by acquaintance</q> but may
be <q>known by description</q>. But the existence of epistemic
bottlenecks, or rather of objects in epistemic bottlenecks, does not presume on
Russell's theory of knowledge.  Indeed the existence of epistemic bottlenecks
does not imply that there are any epistemically closest objects that are known
to us by acquaintance at all.
</p>

<p>
The claim that there are epistemic bottlenecks does not preclude there being
proximal <em>causes</em> of experience without proximal objects <em>of</em> experience.  Our
awareness may always be of more or less distal objects<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Least distal are those objects which directly impinge upon our skin or other sensory surfaces, and the firing of our sensory cells themselves. In psychological texts these are sometime described as proximal stimuli which are <q>directly perceived by our sensory receptors</q>. But of course such events are not directly perceived by <em>us</em> and are not known to us by acquaintance.  By that rigorous standard such impingements still count as distal and there is a sense in which the firing of our sensory cells is not perceived by us at all except with the aid of special equipment (and generally in the third person). Let us avoid being drawn into just where to draw the line between proximal and distal stimuli for the time being.</span></span>. If we perceive
apples, chairs and people without there being intermediary sense-data which we
perceive directly, that does not preclude the existence of epistemic
bottlenecks.

<p>
Another special property many philosophers have attributed to sense-data
is that each of us has infallible knowledge of our own sense-data.
</p>
<blockquote>
Each sense has one kind of object which it discerns, and never errs in
reporting that what is before it is colour or sound (though it may err as to
what it is that is coloured or where that is, or what it is that is sounding
or where that is). Such objects are what we call the special objects of this
or that sense.
<br>(Aristotle, <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8bh0gh94"><cite>De Anima</cite></a>, Book II, Section 6)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
the intellect can never be deceived by any experience, provided that when
the object is presented to it, it intuits it in a fashion exactly
corresponding to the way in which it possesses the object, either within
itself or in the imagination.
<br>(Descartes, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511805042"><cite>Rules for the Direction of the Mind</cite></a>, Rule Twelve)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
as far as ideas<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">In the next paragraph Descartes explicitly includes sensations such as <q>hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire</q> among his ideas.</span></span> are concerned, provided they are considered solely
in themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot strictly
speaking be false; for whether it is a goat or a chimera that I am
imagining, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the latter. 
<br>(Descartes, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511818998"><cite>Third Meditation</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
since all actions and sensations of the mind are known to us by
consciousness, they must necessarily appear in every particular what they
are, and be what they appear.
<br>(Hume, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511818998"><cite>Third Meditation</cite></a>)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is correctly said that the senses do not err; yet not because they always
judge correctly, but because they do not judge at all
<br>(Kant, <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gvpc8p9x0"><cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite></a>, A293)
</blockquote>

<p>
No such infallibility is attributed to our knowledge of the objects in epistemic
bottlenecks in general. However, as our main concern is with relationships
between the objects in epistemic bottlenecks and the claims
made concerning the objects on the far side, it may occasionally simplify
matters to assume (contrary to fact) that our knowledge of the objects in the
particular bottleneck in question is infallible in some places is a simplifying assumption to
consider our
</p>


<p>
it will be convenient, much of the time, to assume that we have certain
knowledge of the objects in the epistemic bottleneck
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, for our purposes we may pretend that the objects described in the
theory or statement are known with certainty, or at least without any practical
doubt for the purposes of the conversation at hand, and so we may take the
conditions of the relevant bottleneck as the only confirmation conditions of the
statement or theory in question.

Thus for instance, it does not matter, 
whether our beliefs concerning the objects on the far side of an epistemic
bottleneck are justified by our beliefs about the objects in the relevant
epistemic bottleneck or by virtue of the fact that they are reliably caused by
objects in the relevant or are justified by those

It is however precluded that there are loops of epistemic dependency. If we know
of electrons, say, partly by their influence on protons, and of protons partly
by their influence on electrons then neither is on the far side of an epistemic
bottleneck that the other is in. Either both

motion of bluetooth mice? There is no shortage of tedious philosophers who raise

bottlenecks or other at some points in the flow of information to us from the
objects of which we have knowledge. Even if there are no clear input and output
registers, and what is taken as "ultimate evidence" depends on context and
passing interests, that is still compatible with the existence of epistemic
bottlenecks, and hence still compatible with the arguments on offer here.

In the next section we shall begin to make claims regarding the complexity of
the sequences of states of the objects in epistemic bottlenecks. In order for
those evaluations of the complexity of sets of sequences of states we require
there to be . Thus, rather than talking about the structure of the states of
affairs themselves, which come in such multifarious forms that they resist, and
any abstraction may be felt to include some unacknowledged assumption concerning
the nature of those. We can instead rely upon the device of semantic ascent, and
instead . What then is the required structure of the statements that we can know
