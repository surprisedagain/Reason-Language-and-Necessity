   this does not decide internalism/externalism. If we are in this situation
   what can we know of the objects that are on the far side of the relevant
   epistemic bottleneck. The first obvious question is under what circumstances
   can we know or are we justified in believing that anything is on the far side

          objects on the far side and having no contact with the properties of

intro: three reasons for rejecting semantic holism as presented by quine

<ol>
<li>
rejection of intentional idioms
			The abandonment of the intentional idiom is the chief threat of
			semantic holism.  It is the price that was too high to be paid. The
			notion that all intentional idoms are essentially nonsense, on the
			level of play acting, and as subject to being evaluated as wrong as
			a gambit in improv theatre, is simply unacceptable.

<li>


<li>
Lack of solid foundations from which to argue
			 See Goodman's paper <a href="../00.notes/quinean_reasoning.html">wn.notes:quinean_reasoning</a>
			  If I like the premise and dislike the conclusion why not simply
			  reject that form of inference. It doesnt preserve truth in this
			  case and that it does in general is just another piece of
			  <q>background knowledge</q>

</ol>
<p>
Simple principle if our predictions are so complex that they require the
postulation of objects, then so too are our expectations. 
The complexity that lies on the far side of an epistemic bottleneck is mirrored
by the processes and structures that give rise to our expectations on this side
(when those expectations are correct). 
</p>

<p>
On one side of an epistemic bottleneck, a subject who has knowledge/justifiably
beliefs about the patterns of states of the objects in the relevant epistemic

say the theory of general relativity). On the other

<li>

</ol>
<p>
seen from this view the meandering path of Wittgenstein staggering through the
philosophical ivestigations makes sense. One the one hand driven not to deny the
complexity of intentional attitudes, on the other refusing on the principle that
everything that can be known about people's mental lives/belief
formation/prediction generating system can be known purely on the basis of
observing their behaviour.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
objects of intensional attitudes

</ol>
<p>
What is taken as the fundamental evidence for this is not the sequences of
states of affairs of the objects in the relevant epistemic bottleneck. But
rather the expectations of the arrangements in the relevant epistemic bottleneck
held by the relevant observer/theorist.
</p>

<p>
Not a Cartesian theatre
The Cartesian theatre is widely understood as a theory of perception. What is
less widely realised is that it is also connected with an account of
representation. The inner perceiver, the 
To think about objects in the external world is to <em>imagine</em> or be disposed to
imagine objects on the Cartesian theatre.
Arrangements of objects on the Cartesian stage is at least one way, perhaps the
most foundational way, in which we can represent the world to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Also contrast with previous scholastic model of representation
see <a href="../00.notes/benYami2015-descartesPhilosophicalRevolution.html">wn.notes:benYami2015-descartesPhilosophicalRevolution</a>
</p>

<p>
Ways in which the cartesian model is wanting:

<li>
doesnt explain the attitude towards the phenomena that uses them as
	 representations. It is only when the guide uses them to base her beliefs
	 about the trian on them. When we treat them as representations.

</ol>
  
<ol>
<li>
causation and representation alignment not perfect. 

</ol>

<p>
text to insert [????
</p>

<p>
Our phenomena, do not merely cause us to have beliefs about
the world, they themselves are about the world. They are a way our minds
<em>represent</em> the external world to itself.
Although the relationship between sensations and figments of the imagination was
always a difficulty for these views. (Often, if unsatisfactorily, described as a
difference of vividity, or faintness or precision<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Dennett himself appeals to lack of detail for the somewhat similar purpose of distinguishing hallucinations from merely false beliefs</span></span>.)
To imagine a state of affairs is, according to these views, to arrange phenomena
or some kind of faint echo of them, on the Cartesian stage.  On the other hand,
such phenomena are often caused by the external objects they represent. The
causal relationship between external objects and the phenomena that represent
them (or our knowledge of it) is a key part of the justification of our
confidence that our perceptions are veridical.  Explaining why this alignment is
neither perfect nor coincidental is one of the chief problems for both Cartesian
theatre accounts of and the neurological accounts that Dennett prefers. In
neither case, however, need it be assumed that the properties of
phenomenal/neurological representations are identical with the properties that
they represent (and which, when things go well, cause those representations to
exist).
-????
</p>

<p>
Cartesian cont.: the quest for normal circumstances. That way we could identify &hellip;
Cartesian theories presented a clear example of backward looking theories of
meaning. (this percept is caused by that property)
the properties represented by phenomenal objects could be determined purely by
looking back at what caused those phenomenal instantiating those properties.

cannot represent it/learn to use a language in which that property is attributed

<p>
rigid designators goes in here
[ !
Even worse, to avoid the counterexamples presented by undeniably contingent
identity statements (such as <q>The first violin in the Tasmanian Symphony
Orchestra is the tallest person in Hobart</q>) the terms replacing the
placeholders <q>a</q> and <q>b</q> in the above schema had to be so-called rigid
designators. Unlike definite descriptions such as <q>the tallest person in
Hobart</q> which might denote different people in different possible worlds,
rigid designators denoted the same individual in every possible world no matter
how its properties might vary from one possible world to another.
While rigid designators can be defined in formal modal languages, where it can
be simply stipulated whether objects in two different possible worlds are the
same, the problem of our epistemic access to identity across different possible
worlds, and hence our capacity to learn and use rigid designators, raised much
the same issues as our knowledge of necessary truths in the first place<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">see Trans-world Heir Lines????</span></span>.
If what made claims involving modal operators and rigid designators true was how
things stood in other possible worlds, but other possible worlds had no causal
connection with this world or the process by which our beliefs were formed then
how was the consonance between our beliefs and how things stand in other
possible worlds to be explained?

I will say that a signal (structure, event, state) carries the information
that s is F in digital form if and only if the signal carries no additional
information about s, no information that is not already nested in s’s being
F.  If the signal does carry additional information about s, information
that is not nested in s’s being F, then I shall say that the signal carries
this information in analog form. When a signal carries the information that
s is F in analog form, the signal always carries more specific, more
determinate, information about s than that it is F.22
