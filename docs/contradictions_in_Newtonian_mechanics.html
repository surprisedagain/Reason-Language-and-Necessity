There is a paper here i saw. Author had Asian name?
Contradictions in newtonian mechanics
quite modern - post 2000?

<div id="solution"><h1 id="solution" class="header"><a href="#solution">solution</a></h1></div>
<p>
<span id="solution-!2"></span><span class="tag" id="!2">!2</span> look up paper about whizzing off and whizzing in objects.
objects that accelerate constantly can disappear into infinity - therir velocity
becoming infinite. Hmm maybe not constant acceleration? maybe parabolic
acceleration or reverse harmonic? - anyway
</p>

<p>
The work done on such an object (W = F x d) would be infinite.
Newtonians still have a notion of energy although they do not have e=mc^2
If they claim that the universe has finite energy (a seemingly motivatable
assumption) then nothing has enough energy to to this disapparing/appearing
trick.
