<p>
We may have just reviewed the history of modern philosophy and seen that far
from being at odds with it modal skepticism can present a coherent history
according to which it is the culmination rather than the rejection of the
developments. There remain, however, other significant objections that have been
traditionally used to 
</p>

<p>
Before we can consider the view further we must deal with these objections
</p>

<p>
Rejection of the distinction between necessary and contingent truths is so
profoundly at odds with our inherited account of reasoning that it is often
dismissed out of hand before being seriously considered. In order to make
it reasonable to consider this view further, some immediate objections must
first be dealt with.

<p>
If it were only a question of providing foundations for philosophy, the conflict
between our scientific theories and our understanding of ourselves as reasoning
beings might be resolved (as popular scientists such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&amp;oldid=1194043681#Philosophy">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-consolation-of-philos/">Lawrence Krauss</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Hawking&amp;oldid=1193926342#Philosophy_is_unnecessary">Stephen Hawking</a>
have suggested) by simply dismissing philosophy as a source of knowledge
altogether. However, the lack of foundations for philosophy is only one aspect
of the more general problem. The lack of an account of reasoning compatible with
our scientific theories is particularly salient in philosophy because, at least
until recently in the Anglo-European tradition, philosophy was thought of as a
field in which knowledge was pursued <em>by reason alone</em> (i.e. unaided by the
senses<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Except, perhaps, for the initial acquisition of the relevant concepts as per the traditional view described <a href="initial_objections.html#second problem: the content of scientific theories">above</a> </span></span>&zwj;).  However, even if that demarcation of philosophy is useful,
reason is not the exclusive prerogative of philosophers. People exercise their
capacity to reason in other fields and daily life, and their capacity to do
so is no less puzzling (and perhaps considerably more productive of knowledge)
than that of philosophers<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Indeed one of the puzzles concerning our ability to reason is how reasoning could be so successful in producing knowledge in fields such as mathematics, science and ordinary life and yet so unproductive of knowledge in philosophy.</span></span>.
</p>

<p>
In particular, as many philosophers have noted, scientific theories themselves
rely upon reasoning for their justification. The relationship between science
and philosophy is not like that between modern chemistry and alchemy. Medieval
alchemists may have possessed some knowledge of chemical properties and
reactions buried amongst their superstitions and esoteric theories, but alchemy
has been altogether superseded by chemistry. The methods and principles of
alchemy have been either rejected or justified by means entirely within the
field of chemistry, leaving no residual core of alchemical principles which
modern chemistry relies upon but cannot justify. By contrast, modern science
appears to be unavoidably reliant upon necessary principles in which belief is
justified by much the same means as those by which ancient philosophers
justified their beliefs in the truths of geometry. Not only do scientific
theories contain mathematical claims, but the relationship between scientific
theories and the evidence that supports them appears to involve necessary truths
that are not themselves known through scientific investigation. Whether a
scientific principle or theory is supported by a given range of evidence seems,
ultimately, to be a necessary truth that is not itself discoverable by empirical
scientific investigation (though scientific investigation may reveal whether
that evidence happens to exist). In both these ways, our knowledge of necessary
truths appears to remain indispensable to the justification of scientific
theories and yet apparently unjustifiable by scientific methods.
</p>

<p>
A conclusion some philosophers have drawn from the apparent dependence of
science upon unscientific knowledge of valid inferences and necessary truths, is
that science can never undermine reason as a source of knowledge of necessary
truths without undermining itself. If, on their view, no being capable of
discerning necessary truths can be constructed from the materials postulated in
our best scientific theories, then that only shows that the scientific image of
the world is partial (and perhaps some aspects of reality are beyond the reach
of scientific discovery altogether). Indeed some philosophers who are attracted
to this line of reasoning have dubbed the view that no aspect of reality is
beyond scientific discovery <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scientism&amp;oldid=1193255716"><q>Scientism</q></a>, and decry such Scientism as one
of the great intellectual errors of the current age (see external link).
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see why this line of reasoning might appeal to philosophers. It
neatly defends the continued relevance and value of philosophical enquiries to
successful knowledge production in the sciences and tacitly establishes
philosophy as the queen of the sciences. Attributing to it the responsibility of
establishing necessary principles upon which scientific theories depend.
However, the claim that science is partial leaves the conflict between our
scientific understanding of the world and our understanding of ourselves as
reasoning beings unresolved; for it does not explain how our capacity to gain
knowledge of necessary truths can affect aspects of reality (such as our bodily
movements) of which knowledge can be gained by scientific means and yet remain
beyond scientific discovery itself. Worse yet, the conclusion that if scientific
theories are incompatible with our having the capacity to gain knowledge of
necessary truths then we could not know those theories to be true is only
reached by taking key elements of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning for granted.

Our fall will be your defeat!-knowledge of scientific theories not dependent upon knowledge of necessary truths"><h3 id="knowledge of scientific theories not dependent upon knowledge of necessary truths" class="header"><a href="#initial objections-Wretched science, after taking from us your valid inferences, do you overthrow us?

<p>
Many, perhaps all, scientific theories contain mathematical and logical truths<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Statements that are true under all interpretations of their non-logical or non-mathematical terms</span></span>.
Statements which, at least by the lights of the traditional account of knowledge
and reasoning, are true necessarily. Furthermore, those mathematical and logical
statements are often indispensable to those theories. No alternative theory that
does not contain those statements (or translations of them) captures the same
observable predictions as consequences. In this sense it is true that scientific
theories are dependent on putative necessary truths.
</p>

<p>
By and large, however, scientific theories do not contain ascriptions of
necessity (or possibility). Theories such as such as Newtonian mechanics,
general relativity and atomic theory, for instance, contain statements asserting
that multiplication is commutative; but they do not contain statements asserting
that multiplication is <em>necessarily</em> commutative. Scientific theories contain
statements that may be rendered into the clear notation of modal logic as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<img src="zz.images/multiplicationCommutative.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>
but they do not contain explicit ascriptions of necessity such as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<img src="zz.images/multiplicationNecessarilyCommutative.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>
Furthermore, there is a <em>prima facie</em> plausible explanation for this lack.
Scientific theories are in the business of explaining, or at least predicting,
our observations. Although the details are still disputed, it is the success of
scientific theories in predicting our observations that justifies belief in the
statements they contain. (Though this is not to assume we could not be justified
in believing some of those statements on other grounds.) What happens in other
possible worlds, to borrow the language of modal realists such as David
Lewis, is irrelevant to our observations in this real world. For the purpose of
predicting our observations it matters not one whit whether multiplication is
commutative in other possible worlds so long as it is commutative in this world.
(Nor does it matter if the rules of inference relied upon to delineate the
statements contained in a scientific theory preserve truth in other worlds so
long as they do in this one.)
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that scientific theories <em>cannot</em> include modal ascriptions.
That ascriptions of modality are somehow incoherent, unclear or otherwise
unsuited to <q>limning the true and ultimate structure of reality</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9636.001.0001">quine1960-wordAndObject</a>&zwj;</span></span>.
If what was true in other possible worlds somehow influenced what we observed in
this real world (perhaps via people's capacity to reason and thence their
actions) then a true explanation of our observations would have to include
ascriptions of possibility and necessity, and if that were the best available
explanation of our observations then we would be justified in believing it<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">It may be objected that possible worlds cannot influence each other <em>by definition</em>.  That if parallel universes influence events in this one then they are not other possible worlds but only some further part of this possible world and the sort of modality they would warrant introducing into our scientific theories would not be the absolute modality of possibility and necessity. I have nothing to gainsay this objection, except to note that it only strengthens the claim currently being defended; viz., that the observations which justify belief in scientific theories concerning natural phenomena do not justify beliefs in modal ascriptions.</span></span>.
Indeed there are occasional, somewhat fevered, suggestions that such influences
occur in quantum mechanics. If evidence of such influences were discovered, the
use of modal operators in scientific theories might well be justified. Thus far,
however, no such influences from other possible worlds have been detected and no
modern scientific explanations of our observations contain such ascriptions<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">In recent times philosophers have paid great attention to putative <em>a posteriori</em> necessities, such as <q>Water is necessarily H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O</q>. However, the necessity of such statements hinges upon ways in which affairs in one world <em>w<sub><small>0</small></sub></em> affect which other possible worlds statements made in <em>w<sub><small>0</small></sub></em> are true of. If such ascriptions of necessity are justified at all, it is as elements of explanations of our linguistic and cognitive capacities, and not as explanations of the observations upon which our theories of chemistry are founded. See <a class="heavy" href="a_posteriori_necessities*.html">a_posteriori_necessities*</a>.</span></span>.
</p>

<p>
If (1) scientific theories contained ascriptions of necessity, (2) all the
materials postulated in scientific theories were insensitive to modal properties
and relationships, and (3) no reasoning creature capable of knowing ascriptions
of necessity to be true could be composed of purely modally insensitive
materials; <em>then</em> it would follow that if our scientific theories were not
partial (i.e. there were not elements of reality, and more particularly elements
of the creatures who believed these theories, of a kind other than those
postulated in our scientific theories and governed by laws other than those our
scientific theories claim govern other natural phenomena) then we could not know
those theories to be true. In this sense the claim that no aspect of reality was
beyond scientific discovery would be pragmatically self-defeating; for we could
not know those theories if they were false, and if they were true then we could
not know the ascriptions of necessity that they contained. However, our current
best scientific theories do not contain such ascriptions, and it is only by
taking it for granted that we know that some of the statements contained by
scientific theories are necessarily true that the claim that science is total
is made to appear pragmatically self-defeating.
</p>

<p>
Another way in which our knowledge of scientific theories might be thought to
depend upon our knowledge of necessary truths is via their evidential support.
Though, again, the details are still disputed, our belief in scientific theories
is somehow justified by their success in predicting (and retrodicting) our
observations. Our capacity to determine those theories observable predictions,
may be thought to require us to have knowledge of necessary truths. As a modern
adherent of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
In setting out to confirm an inductive hypothesis, we must be able to
recognize what its consequences would be. Ordinarily, to recognize these we
must apply deduction; we take the hypothesis along with other things that we
know and we see what is then implied. All of this, it would seem, involves
apprehension of truths of reason <br>
<br>
These truths pertain to certain abstract or eternal objects--things such as
properties, numbers, and propositions or states of affairs, things that
would exist even if there weren't any contingent things such as persons and
physical objects.<br>
(<a href="chisholm1987-truths_of_reason.html">R. Chisholm, _Truths of Reason_, 1987</a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
If our capacity to determine the observable consequences of scientific theories
were dependent upon our capacity to distinguish arguments that necessarily
preserved truth; then, again, the claim that science was total (and hence the
principles which, according to our best scientific theories, govern the
rest of the natural world also govern our behaviour and the formation of our
beliefs) would be pragmatically self-defeating. If our scientific theories were
true then we could not know them to be so. But again, this is merely a
particularly partisan way of saying that if our scientific theories preclude
sensitivity to modal properties and relationships then they are incompatible
with theories of knowledge, such as the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning, according to which such sensitivity is required for knowledge.
</p>

<p>
The reason these arguments are so widely taken as establishing that the
(non-modal) principles which, according to our best scientific theories, govern
the rest of the natural world, do not govern our actions and the formation of
our beliefs, is that elements of the traditional account of knowledge are
still deeply embedded in our<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">or at least the Anglo-European</span></span> common understanding of ourselves. The
Aristotelian principle that in the best and most certain form of knowledge
(<em>epistêmê</em> - the sort of knowledge we have of geometry, logic and mathematics)
we are aware of the thing known <q>that it is not possible for [it] to be
otherwise</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8bh0gh94">aristotle-completeWorks.oxfordRevisedTrans</a>, <em>Posterior Analytics</em> Book 1 Section 2</span></span> and that all our other knowledge is dependent on our
possession of this best form of knowledge, remains so fundamental
to folk epistemology that any questioning of this principle is easily taken as
tantamount to skepticism.
</p>

<p>
Our knowledge of scientific theories is no doubt dependent upon our ability to
reason (including, among other things, the ability to infer the logical
consequences of a theory from its axioms) but it is not dependent upon the truth
of any one particular explanation of that ability. In particular it is not
dependent upon the truth of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning.
The conflict between our scientific theories and that account of knowledge and
reasoning does not imply that we do not know those theories, but only that
<em>either</em> we do not know those theories <em>or</em> the traditional account of knowledge
and reasoning is wrong.

<p>
<del>TRADITIONAL THEORY NOT SPECIALLY PRIVILEGED</del>
Attentive readers may have wondered at the caveat in the claim of the last
section that <em>by and large</em> scientific theories do not contain ascriptions of
necessity. The reason for this reservation is that on the view 
advocated here, the traditional account of reasoning is itself, if not a
scientific theory<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">The most commonly given reason for denying that the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning is best understood as an scientific theory is that it is inextricably bound up with normative judgements. Of course, normative judgements may be made about the states postulated in explanatory theories. Belief-desire psychology is an explanatory theory concerning psychological states which gains credence from its success in predicting people's actions, but for all that some desires may be held to be improper. But in the case of theories of knowledge it is often claimed that there is a closer connection to normative judgements.</span></span>, at least like a scientific theory in being a theory in
which belief is justified by its success in predicting and explaining our
observations.
</p>

<p>
Like the falsehood of the theory of perception upon which the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning relied; the falsehood of the claim that there
are necessary and contingent truths (and unaided reason can only justify
knowledge of the former) does not imply that we do not have knowledge or cannot
reason, but only that the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning is
wrong. However, the traditional theory of perception involved claims concerning
the processes by which the properties of external objects were transmitted to our
minds via our sensory organs. Claims which were comparatively easily
refuted by empirical investigation of the physical processes involved
in perception. By contrast, the claim that we are are capable of distinguishing
necessary truths draws its chief support from its explanation of our
introspective awareness of our own thought processes.  Its credibility is
largely due to the explanation it offers of the introspectively felt difference
between statements such as <q>All widows have been married.</q> and <q>All
widows are near the Earth.</q>. The immediacy of the introspective awareness of
a distinction between these two types of statement, and its direct connection to
the diagnosis of necessity/contingency gives this diagnosis an
unwarranted credibility. This has made this last lingering element of the
traditional account of knowledge and reasoning particularly resistant to
correction (see <a class="heavy" href="introspection_not_a_source_of_theoretical_knowledge.html">introspection_not_a_source_of_theoretical_knowledge</a>).
However, while an alternative account of our capacity to reason does need to
explain what it is about these sentences that we are responding to, it does not
need to take the diagnosis of sensitivity to necessity/contingency at face
value, and questioning that diagnosis need not plunge us into skepticism.

<p>
As Bertrand Russell one noted in connection with a man obsessed with people's
consumption of nuts, obsessives tend to think that their particualr bete noire
is at the root of the worlds ills.
</p>

<p>
Obsessives frequently believe that the particular topic they are obsessed with
is the key to solving the worlds problems. I am, apparently, no exception. For
it does seem to me that the absence of an plausible account of good reasoning
(i.e. one that provides an etiology of our actions compatible with those actions
being caused by processes composed of the materials that our scientific theories
say they are) and the tendency in more modern philosophy to simply accept this
absence, has had a profound affect on broader society.
</p>

<p>
This influence can be seen in post-modernism, which questions the very idea of
determinant content
</p>

<p>
except of course for themselves and the hallowed members of their chosen sect
and can be viewed as resulting from loss of faith in the very idea of content at
all. To take content seriously is to be naive, deconstruction is a matter of
treating supposed content as mere evidence, signs as grist for speculative
interpretation. Instead of providing a determinate representation of an external
world, assertions are evidence about the state of mind of the people who utter
them.  Psychoanalysis, in which the patients proclamations are taken as evidence
of their state of mind, and analysis of the power relations revealed between
asserters and listeners, are the order of the day. They replace reasoned debate
taking the representational content of the disputed claim as objectively fixed
and objectively either true or false.
</p>

<p>
As Bertrand Russell once wrote after a discussion with a man who believed that
people should eat nothing but nuts, most obsessives believe that their
particular bête noire is at the root of the worlds problems. I
am no exception to this rule. It is certainly tempting to believe that the
lack of a sense of a commonly agreed standard of good reasoning has played some

The need for an account of how reason justifies belief goes deeper than merely
reconciling our traditional understanding of ourselves with our latest
empirically supported theories. Other features and capacities attributed to us
in our traditional theories (the so called <q>manifest image</q> of ourselves)
can simply be rejected altogether. We can, if need be, reconcile our account of
free will with our current scientific theories by simply denying that we have
free will at all and supplying an alternative account of the causes of our
actions. So too for the hard problem of consciousness, we may simply deny that
we have qualia or are conscious in the way described in traditional theories,
and supply an alternative account of how there is a way the world appears to us.
Some have even gone so far as to deny that we possess beliefs at all and have
attempted to provide an alternative account of what lies behind our sincere
assertions.  Whether the offered alternatives can do justice to the phenomena
the traditional theories sought to explain is, of course, a matter of debate,
but at least in principle in these other areas the traditional account can be
denied. Our capacity to justify beliefs by reasoning, however, cannot be denied.
Not only, as are principles discerned by reason indispensable to the scientific
theories with which reconciliation is sought, but the proponents of any of these
alternatives will themselves rely on reasoning to justify their claims. Reason,
like intensionality, and unlike free will, is an indispensable component of our
understanding of ourselves.
</p>

<p>
the consolidation of our theories of the world into a consistent and coherent
whole (at least in the sense that they may all be true of the same unitary
world) is a central traditional project of philosophy. Sellars famous pithy The best known pithy
expression of this objective is perhaps Sellars claim that the aim of philosophy
<q>is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang
together in the broadest possible sense of the term</q>. To this end we require
an account of our capacity to reason that is compatible with our scientific
theories of the world (if need be, by deliniating and acknowledging aspects of
ourselves that are omitted from scientific theories).
</p>

<p>
Whether the modern attempts to explain the justification of the knowledge of
necessary truths are regarded as a new response to an unprecedented crisis
created by the mismatch between scientific discoveries and the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning, or as the continuation of an ancient
enquiry; the manifest falsehood of the traditional theory of knowledge has
left us without any coherent account of the justification of our knowledge of
necessary truths.
