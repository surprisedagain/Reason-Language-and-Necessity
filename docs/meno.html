<p>
The Platonic dialog in which Socrates demonstrates geometrical reasoning and
explains our capacity to reason as being due to anamnesis (recollection of
knowledge acquired before birth). Generally held to be one of the <q>middle
dialogues</q> in which Plato began to advance his own positive views.
</p>

<div id="main"><h1 id="main" class="header"><a href="#main">main</a></h1></div>
<p>
The Meno contains the oldest exemplar of deductive reasoning in the western
tradition<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">While the geometrical claims involved were certainly known in other cultures (see <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math184/notes.pdf">donaldson2022-ancientMathematicsNotes</a>) I am unaware of any other tradition in which general deductive arguments were presented to justify such claims, or considered as objects of investigation or interest in their own right.</span></span>. In it Socrates teaches a hitherto ignorant slave boy how to
construct a square double the size of a given square. (The relevant section
begins on p. 40)
</p>

<p>
At first the boy mistakenly believes that the method to double the size of
a square is to double the length of each of the sides<br>
(i.e. that the solid blue square below is double the area of the red one).
</p>

<p>
<img src="zz.images/wrongDouble.png" />
</p>

<p>
Socrates, however, convinces the boy that this new square will in fact be four
times as large as the original. Then Socrates shows him that the correct method
is to draw the square based on the diagonal of the original<br>
(i.e. that the true double of the red square is in fact the dashed blue square
below).
</p>

<p>
<img src="zz.images/rightDouble.png" />
</p>

<p>
The point is that the boy does not gain additional information.  He neither
observes some new feature nor does Socrates tell him what is the case. Instead,
when the matter is clearly put before him, or perhaps broken up into simple
enough steps (though this is a dangerously misleading analogy) he is able to
discern the truth himself without further instruction. As Socrates puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
Attend now to the questions which I ask him, and observe whether he learns
of me or only remembers.
</blockquote>
<p>
Though Socrates' questions are doubtless leading:
</p>
<blockquote>
Yet it does nothing to invalidate Plato's main point, which is that a
previously untutored slave is able to recognise as indubitably true (or
false) propositions brought to his notice for the first time.
(Gulley, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203085905"><cite>Plato's Theory of Knowledge</cite></a>, 1962, p.10.1)
</blockquote>

<div id="main-theory of recollection"><h2 id="theory of recollection" class="header"><a href="#main-theory of recollection">theory of recollection</a></h2></div>
<p>
The <em>Meno</em> is where Plato first introduces the theory of recollection. According
to this theory all knowledge is recollected from previous lives. In the Meno the
suggestion is these are recollections from previous lives in this world, but
elsewhere Plato suggests that these are recollections from a divine realm in
which we existed before being born as human.
</p>

<p>
But there is obviously a huge qualifier here. One does not learn that it is
currently raining, or that in Sydney George Street crosses Pitt St by
recollection from a previous life.  So when Socrates claims that:
</p>
<blockquote>
The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been born again many times,
and having seen all things that exist, whether in this world or in the
world below, has knowledge of them all; and it is no wonder that she should
be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and
about everything; for as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all
things, there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning, out
of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is strenuous and does not
faint; for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection
</blockquote>

<p>
His claim can only be made plausible by a tacit restriction as to the sort of
knowledge involved. It is knowledge of <q>the nature of</q> things, knowledge
such as geometrical knowledge - knowledge of the unchanging eternal (which Greek
mystical traditions appear to have held to be the marker of true reality - that
which is, <span id="main-theory of recollection-is"></span><strong id="is">is</strong> and does not change). For our purposes it is tempting 
</p>

<div id="main-paradox of enquiry"><h2 id="paradox of enquiry" class="header"><a href="#main-paradox of enquiry">paradox of enquiry</a></h2></div>
<p>
The interaction with the slave boy is prompted by Meno putting forward a version
of the paradox of analysis:
</p>
<blockquote>
<span id="main-paradox of enquiry-Meno"></span><strong id="Meno">Meno</strong>: And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not
know? What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you find
what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did
not know?<br>
<span id="main-paradox of enquiry-Socrates"></span><strong id="Socrates">Socrates</strong>: I know, Meno, what you mean; but just see what a tiresome
dispute you are introducing. You argue that man cannot enquire either about
that which he knows, or about that which he does not know; for if he knows,
he has no need to enquire; and if not, he cannot; for he does not know the,
very subject about which he is to enquire.<br>
<span id="main-paradox of enquiry-Meno"></span><strong id="Meno">Meno</strong>: Well, Socrates, and is not the argument sound?
</blockquote>

<div id="main-a further mystery of irrational numbers"><h2 id="a further mystery of irrational numbers" class="header"><a href="#main-a further mystery of irrational numbers">a further mystery of irrational numbers</a></h2></div>
<p>
One of the lovely features of Plato's dialogues is how many levels they work on
simultaneously. As is well known, each of the characters Socrates interrogates
is exemplifies the sort of personality that is attracted to the doctrines
they espouse. Hence there is a sense both that these issues touch upon each
individuals whole approach to life and not merely their intellectual beliefs in
isolation.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the Meno, this layering applies to the geometrical argument as
well. Tyro geometrician can appreciate the strength of Socrates argument and
count themselves knowledgeable for being able to understand Socrates proof that
the square on the diagonal is double the size of the original (see the second
image above as above)
</p>

<p>
But there is a deeper mystery concealed within Socrates example. At one point
Socrates asks the boy of the length of the sides of this doubled square
</p>
<blockquote>
<span id="main-a further mystery of irrational numbers-Socrates"></span><strong id="Socrates">Socrates</strong>: Then the line which forms the side of eight feet ought to be more
than this line of two feet, and less than the other of four feet?<br>
<span id="main-a further mystery of irrational numbers-Boy"></span><strong id="Boy">Boy</strong>: It ought. <br>
<span id="main-a further mystery of irrational numbers-Socrates"></span><strong id="Socrates">Socrates</strong>: Try and see if you can tell me how much it will be.
</blockquote>

<p>
If we set the length of each side of the original square to 2, then the length
of each side of the dashed blue square (the true double in area) is the square
root of eight, which is an irrational number. The Greeks lacked a notation for
naming such numbers.
</p>

<p>
It is tempting to think that there is a suggestion of an irresolvable mystery
concerning the nature of virtue (the supposed overarching subject of enquiry
for the dialogue). An intended moral may be that we can never achieve a precise
definition of virtue but only ever closer (rational) approximations to it.
