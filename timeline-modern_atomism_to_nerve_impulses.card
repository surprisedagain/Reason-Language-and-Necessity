=== of particular note ===
Gassendi's main argument for believing in sub-visible particles is that paving
stones and plowshares gradually wear away because of constant rubbing even
though individual acts of rubbing produce no discernible change.  Another is
that the passage of odors through the air can be explained in terms of tiny
particles traveling from the original body to the nose. His argument for the
indivisibility of these particles (atoms) is based upon Zeno's paradox.

Gassendi's belief in the void is largely, though not entirely, based upon
consideration of the space (void) at the top of mercury barometers.

It has been suggested (I can't recall the source) that Galileo that curiously
derived the correct law for motion due to gravity from the false assumption that
the speed of fall grows in proportion to the space traversed, rather than to the
time elapsed.

== background of mechanistic speculation ==
Like [[collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning#new understanding of the physiological processes of perception|Galileo's description of acceleration due to gravity]] in 1604, the laws
Newton laid out 80 years later in his
_Mathematical principles of Natural Philosophy_ (1687) were also quantitative
and explicitly based upon experimental data. It is notable, however, that Newton
vigorously rejected the description of his work as <q>experimental
philosophy</q> and insisted, somewhat inconstantly, that his laws of motion were
not hypotheses which he had tested against empirical evidence, but rather
regularities of nature which could simply be read off from the empirical data he
had assembled. This rejection may be more easily understood once the range of
hypotheses ventured by his contemporaries and immediate predecessors is
recognized.

In between these breakthroughs, it is striking how little any of the
multitude of mechanistic physical theories proposed by European natural
philosophers were supported by observation or experiment. Descartes
proposed mechanistic theories concerning magnetism, the pumping of blood, the
movement of cosmological bodies, the nature of heat and the mechanism of sight,
but the only point at which he overtly based his theories upon his own
experimental observations concerned the splitting of sunlight into a spectrum by
refraction through a prism or glass ball filled with water.  Gassendi, the most
influential of the modern atomists before Boyle, ventured explanations of some
physical phenomena (such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog|sundogs]] which had been widely observed in Rome
in 1629) and noted the new visions revealed through microscopes, but he
justified his belief in discrete atoms more by references to Lucretius and the
avoidance of Zeno's paradox than any empirical observation.

Galileo's published works inspired generations of natural philosophers to reject
any but mechanistic theories. Theories in which physical phenomena were
explained purely in terms of the size, shape and motion of bodies acting on each
other only through direct contact.  In Hobbes words:
    as for those that say any thing may be moved or produced by it Self, by
    Species, by its own Power, by Substantial Forms, by Incorporeal Substances,
    by Instinct, by Anteperistasis, by Antipathy, Sympathy, Occult Quality, and
    other empty words of Schoolmen, their saying so is to no purpose.
    <br>([[https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t5x70nh11|_Elements of Philosophy_]] 1656)
But Galileo's influence did not cure those natural philosophers of their
speculative tendencies, nor of their general preference for armchair theorizing
over menial laboratory experiments.  Indeed, as good constraints often do, the
constraints on mechanistic theories caused creative speculation to flourish.

Even if the eventual sensations that these processes led up to were, as
Descartes held, non-physical, an account of the external bodies that travelled
from distant objects to our sensory organs was required, together with an
account of how those bodies interacted with the sensory organs and the
mechanisms conveying signals from those organs to the brain (or heart or
wherever else the locus of interactions between body and mind was held to be).

As history turned out, it was muscular movements, rather than sensory signals,
that received the lion's share of attention and were the subject of the first
breakthroughs. Here, as with gravity, it was compressive or attractive forces
that proved most difficult to explain in terms of mechanistic interactions.
Indeed, the lack of any plausible mechanism for muscular contractions had led
Descartes to reject Harvey's claim that the blood was pumped by contractions of
the heart, though he accepted the rest of Harvey's theory of blood circulation.
These difficulties aroused a great deal of curiosity about muscular movements
and are one of the reasons why Galvani and Volta's discovery in 1800 that
electrical currents could cause muscles to contract, was immediately regarded as
momentous.

Eventually, the wild speculations of the early mechanists gave way
to well supported theories. Though it was not until 1950 that Hodgkins
and Huxley described the processes by which neurons built up electric voltage
differences and propagated changes in that voltage from axon's to dendrites by
means of the selective permeability of cell membranes. Even today we still do
not have a definitive account of these processes, with some current researchers
contending that nerve impulses are not purely electrical but have a mechanical
component after all (see [[https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2019.00208|Thinking About the Nerve Impulse: The Prospects for the Development of a Comprehensive Account of Nerve Impulse Propagation]], 2019)
