Although they rejected Kant's account of our
knowledge of necessary truths they had nothing to put in its place. In his
[[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#CouPosFriMil|<cite>Course of Positive Philosophy</cite>]] (1830-42) Comte had claimed that
mathematics was the science of distance measurement and like other sciences
its truths concerned contingent regularities in our sensations. J.S. Mill
approached the problem more explicitly, denying that the truths of mathematics
were necessary, and claiming that universal claims (such as <q>All men are
mortal</q> or <q>Each triangles angles sum to two right angles</q>) were mere
reminders of a justified commitment to making real inferences from past
particular observations



Attempts were made to avoid this problem. J.S. Mill, for instance, denied that
the truths of mathematics were necessary at all. Holding instead that held that
all <q>real</q> inferences were from particulars to particulars, and that
universal claims (e.g. <q>All men are mortal</q> or <q>All triangles have
internal angles that sum to 180 degrees</q>) were mere reminders of our
justified commitment to making such inferences (e.g. infering from particular
past observations of humans dying that a particular newly observed human will
also die).

????
[[descartes|Descartes]] broadened the traditional account of knowledge by allowing contingent
truths known with certainty (such as knowledge of one's own existence and
immediate experiences) to serve as first principles in addition to necessary
truths known with certainty (such as the postulates of geometry). He then
attempted to show all knowledge, including both mathematical and scientific
knowledge, could be deduced from those expanded foundations. He did not,
however, venture an account of our ability to gain knowledge of those necessary
first principles beyond describing it as <q>seeing by the clear light of
reason</q> and attributing our possession of it to God's grace. This is not to
criticise Descartes for taking this ability for granted, but simply to note
that his objective in works such as
[[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason_]] and
[[local:zz.texts/descartes2.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Meditations on First Philosophy_]]
was not to explain our knowledge of necessary truths and necessarily truth
preserving arguments, but to to show that from that knowledge, together with
certain knowledge of our own existence and experiences, everything else we know
could be deduced.
????
In his [[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Rules for the Direction of Mind_]] and
[[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason_]], [[Descartes]]
confidently claims to describe a method for <q>seeking truth in the sciences</q>
(including mathematics) that will <q>gradually and constantly increase one’s
knowledge till one arrives at a true understanding of everything within one’s
capacity</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Rules for the Direction of Mind_]])). His promises, however, do not stand up to close inspection.
His descriptions of his <q>method</q> amount to little more than pieces of
general advice on how to approach scientific and mathematical problems; along
the lines of *take nothing for granted*, and *divide problems into smaller parts*.
While these tips can be helpful, Descartes himself acknowledges that the
description of his method does not amount to an account of our capacity to
reason: <q>The method cannot go so far as to teach us how to perform the actual
operations of intuition and deduction, since these are the simplest of all and
quite basic. If our intellect were not already able to perform them, it would
not comprehend any of the rules of the method, however easy they might
be.</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf|_Rules for the Direction of Mind_]]))

Although Descartes does not propose to explain our knowledge of necessary
truths, he does outline prototypical versions of two distinctions that later
philosophers will rely upon in their attempts to explain such knowledge:

The first of these distinctions is between *simple* and *complex* necessary truths.
Simple truths are known as soon as they are clearly considered (by those who
possess <q>some degree of rationality</q>) and no further justification for our
knowledge of them can be given or required. Knowledge of complex truths, by
contrast, requires reasoning for its justification. Reason, on this view, being
the ability to devise, or at least inspect, chains of simple inferences whereby
complex truths may be deduced from truths known with certainty - either
necessary first principles or infallible statements of one's own experiences.

According to Descartes there are <q>simple natures</q> whose
distinguishing feature is being known <q>so clearly and distinctly that they
cannot be divided by the mind into others which are more distinctly known</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]])).
Descartes' examples of such simple natures include properties such as
shape, extension, motion, existence, unity and duration, as well as principles
of Euclidean geometry such as <q>Things that are the same as a third thing are
the same as each other</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]])), and concepts of small integers such as seven.
Sometimes Descartes claims these simple natures are mental entities such as
concepts or ideas, while at other times he says that they are properties of
objects (and at yet others he warns against assuming that our concepts are the 
same as the properties of external objects((<q>the understanding of the wise man will not be deceived in such cases: while he will judge that whatever comes to him from his imagination really is depicted in it, he will never assert that it passes, complete and unaltered, from the external world to his senses, and from his senses to the corporeal imagination, unless he already has some other grounds for claiming to know this.</q>, [[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]]))).  In any case, once these simple
natures are distinguished no error of judgement can be made about them, nor can
our knowledge of them be less than complete. Any rational person simply sees the
modal relationships between these simples by <q>the clear light of reason</q>(([[local:zz.texts/descartes1.philosophicalWritingsOfDescartes.pdf]]))
and hence, once their attention is drawn to them, knows if simple principles
are necessarily true or whether it is necessary, possible or impossible for
an object to possess combinations of simple properties.

It would be a mistake to imagine that Descartes had a coherent, but poorly
expressed, account of simples, which might be unearthed by careful
interpretation of his writing. Rather, whenever Descartes finds a principle
which strikes him as clearly and obviously true, but for which he is unable to
provide a justification((When, in Wittgenstein's much later metaphor, he <q>hits bedrock</q>.)) he simply declares it to be simple or concern a
relationship between simple properties. The appeal to simplicity is an attempt
to explain the phenomena - how can one have clear and certain knowledge of
principles for which one can provide no further justification. The explanation
is that those principles are just too simple for there to be any doubt.  Without
an independent account of simplicity, however, this explanation is vacuous and
the <q>method</q> of reducing complicated propositions to simpler ones (the
fifth of the _Rules for Direction of Mind_) amounts to the practical but
somewhat vague advice to break things down into obvious steps, rather than a
principled account of how knowledge of necessary truths is justified. In the
end, Descartes offers no account of our knowledge of simple truths except for
God's grace, and no method for identifying them except that they seem clear and
obvious.

Descartes' writing also contains occasional hints of a distinction that
later philosophers would draw between contentive truths and empty or merely
verbal truths. Though Descartes does not draw a distinction between sorts of
truths along these lines, he does apply a similar distinction to some forms of
inference.  In particular, he criticises Aristotelian syllogisms on the grounds
that we <q>learn nothing new from such forms of reasoning</q>, saying
<q>dialecticians are unable to formulate a syllogism with a true conclusion
unless they are already in possession of the substance of the conclusion</q>.
Although Descartes does not develop the distinction further, it is worth
noting that a precursor of this distinction, which would eventually become
central to accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths, is already present at
this early stage.

Descartes produced his works prior to the epistemological inversion noted at the
end of the [[#knowledge of necessary truths became the central problem of philosophy|last section]]. His focus is on the truths we may discover by the
application of our ability to reason rather than the nature of that ability
itself. Like the Aristotelian philosophers who preceeded him, he maintained that
all knowledge was deduced from principles known with certainty. Unlike
Aristotle, he took such principles to include both knowledge of necessary first
principles and knowledge of one's own experiences. The chief epistemological
problem he attempted to solve was how to deduce our scientific theories from
such certainties, and thereby place them on the same secure foundations as our
knowledge of mathematics and geometry. He had faith enough in God, confidence
enough in his own abilities, and was so strongly struck by the sense of
<q>seeing clearly</q> that something must be so, that it apparently never
occured to him to venture an account of the foundations of our ability to reason
beyond attributing it to God's grace. 

==== locke ====
Locke's account of our ability to reason in his
[[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|_Essay Concerning Human Understanding_]] is, in many ways, merely a
more refined and systematic version of Descartes'. Like Descartes, he
distinguishes between simple and complex truths, and holds that simple truths
<q>as soon as understood, are, without any the least reasoning, embraced and
assented to</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).  Locke is more careful than Descartes to distinguish mental
entities - <q>ideas</q> - from the properties they represent. He makes it clear that
his simples are ideas, and that necessary simple truths express <q>relations
between ideas</q>.  He goes to considerable lengths to emphasize that these ideas
are not innate, but impressed upon us by experience; but in the end he still
relies upon an innate and unexplained ability to discern simple relations
between ideas once we have experienced them.  In such matters <q>the mind is at
no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the truth as the eye
doth light, only by being directed towards it</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).  The lack of any account of our
knowledge of such truths stands in salient contrast to Locke's hypothesis
concerning the mechanism of sight just five pages later: <q>supposing the
sensation or idea we name whiteness be produced in us by a certain number of
globules, which, having a verticity about their own centres, strike upon the
retina of the eye, with a certain degree of rotation, as well as progressive
swiftness</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).

A notable superiority of Locke's account over Descartes', is that Locke at least
attempts to provide an independent standard of simplicity.  Foremost among
Locke's simple truths are statements of identity and non-identity such as
<q>sweet is not bitter</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])), <q>a circle is not a triangle</q>((ibid.,)) and <q>What is, is</q>((ibid.,)).
It should be noted, however, that Locke uses an older and broader
notion of identity statement than is generally accepted by
logicians today. <q>[B]y identical propositions I mean only such wherein the
same term, importing the same idea, is affirmed of itself</q>((i.e. sentences in which a term occurs as both predicate and subject, [[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])).  The modern
distinction between using <q>is</q> to express identity and using it to express
predication is foreign to him. His prime examples of identical propositions
are those like <q>A centaur is a centaur</q> in which the same term explicitly occurs
as both subject and predicate but when pushed.

More complex truths
Euclidean geometry does include 

Thus he counts both <q>three are equal to one
and two</q>((original: <q>three are more than two and equal to one and two</q>, [[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf]])) and <q>A centaur is a centaur</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]])) as true identity statements. In

and hints at other forms
While he discusses such relations at length, and the various ways in which the
ideas of such relations are formed ,

<q>we cannot but observe that several particular, both qualities and substances,
begin to exist; and that they receive this their existence from the due ap-
plication and operation of some other being</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]]))

some places Locke claims that all simple truths are statements of identity or
non-identity((<q>I grant further, that the foundation of all our knowledge lies in the faculty we have of perceiving the same idea to be the same, and of discerning it from those that are different; as I have shown in the foregoing chapter.</q>, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10615 )). In others, however, he explicitly says there must be simple
truths other than identity statements: <q>For, since all distinct ideas must
eternally be known not to be the same, and so be universally and constantly
denied one of another, there could be no room for any positive knowledge at all,
if we could not perceive any relation between our ideas</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]])) (and here Locke
makes it clear that he intends <q>any relation</q> other than identity).  But he
gives no account of these other simple truths apart from a handful of examples
such as <q>three are more than two</q>(([[local:zz.texts/locke1690.essayConcerningHumanUnderstanding.pdf|ibid.,]])).

first odd square number greater than 1 is equal to two plus one'.

that two lines are the same length or two angles of the same measure by
constructing an intermediate which is shown equal to both.)

is used to prove both Proposition 47 -  Pythagoras’ theorem - and  Proposition

The ability to tell that one idea is identical with itself nd distinct from all
other ideas.

One of the fundamental axioms of Euclid's geometry is that (Postulate 4)
_All angles between two straight lines that are equal to their adjacent angles, are equal to each other._

This cannot be taken as a raw ability to recognise right angles, for
establishing that a particualr angle is a right angle can require lengthy proof.

A raw ability to distinguish different ideas form one another.

Pythagoras's theorem, were precisely *not* statements in which

Locke acknowledges this explicitly:

our ideas and the reality of things.</q>, and goes on to give a blend of three
weak arguments

Another, related, problem is the continued dependence upon the consonance between of ideas
and the external properties they represent


    simple ideas, which since the mind, as has been shown, can by no means make
    to itself, must necessarily be the product of things operating on the mind,
    in a natural way, and producing therein those perceptions which by the
    Wisdom and Will of our Maker they are ordained and adapted to. From whence
    it follows, that simple ideas are not fictions of our fancies, but the
    natural and regular productions of things without us, really operating
    upon us; and so carry with them all the conformity which is intended; or
    which our state requires
this mixes together three distinct reasons for conformity: an appeal to God's
grace, taht since , and 
In the end however, Locke falls back upon the ancient reliance of a match
between our concepts and the properties, so that the modal relations betwene the

into confusions and inconsistencies.
Many of the confusions and inconsistencies that plague Locke's account of our
knowledge

[[leibniz|Leibniz]] is the first modern philosopher to attempt to provide an account of
our knowledge of necessary truths more substantial than simply <q>seeing by
the light of reason</q> that they must be true. He is also the first to suggest
that the chief method of reasoning is the analysis of meanings and the unpacking
of definitions:
    demonstrating is nothing but displaying a certain equality or
    coincidence of the predicate with the subject (in the case of a reciprocal
    proposition) by resolving the terms of a proposition and substituting a
    definition or part of one for that which is defined, or in other cases at
    least displaying the inclusion so that what lies hidden in the proposition
    and was contained in it virtually is made evident and explicit through
    demonstration.
He is also the first to dream of a formal system of logic in which all chains of
deduction would be mechanically checkable. In these firsts he anticipated the
central issues, doctrines and methods of 20th century analytic philosophy,
though in each of them he retained key aspects of the scholastic tradition in
which he had been educated. Indeed his innovations were, in large part, the
product of attempts to resolve tensions between traditional Aristotelian
accounts of knowledge and logic, fundamental principles of christian
theology and our possession of knowledge justified by observation.

The first of these tensions was between God's absolute freedom to create
whatever world they chose and their omniscience. If the most perfect form of
knowledge is that derived from necessarily true first principles by deductive
chains of reasoning, then this is the form of knowledge God must have of every
aspect of the universe. On the other hand if God acted freely in
creating the world then it must have been genuinely possible for them to have
created other worlds instead. Leibniz's solution to this problem was to offer
one of the first absolutely clear distinctions between necessary and
contingent truths:
    After I considered these matters more attentively, a most profound
    distinction between necessary and contingent truths was revealed. Namely,
    every truth is either basic or derivative. Basic truths are
    those for which we cannot give a reason; identities or immediate truths,
    which affirm the same thing of itself or deny the contradictory of [[its]]
    contradictory, are of this sort. Derivative truths are, in turn, of two
    sorts, for some can be resolved into basic truths, and others, in their
    resolution, give rise to a series of steps that go to infinity. The former
    are necessary, the latter contingent.  Indeed, a necessary proposition is
    one whose contrary implies a contradiction.  Every identical proposition and
    every derivative proposition resolvable into identical propositions is of
    such a kind, as are the truths called metaphysical or geometrical
    necessities.
God alone has the capacity to see the infinite series of necessities (both
causal and non-causal) that give rise to contingent truths:
    in contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can
    never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality
    or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone
    seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but
    the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the
    subject, since he sees whatever is in the series. Indeed, this very truth
    was derived in part from his intellect, in part from his will, and it
    expresses his infinite perfection and the harmony of the entire series of
    things in its own particular way.
While it was possible for God to have created otherwise, there was yet
sufficient reason for them to have chosen to create this world because this is
the best of all possible worlds. God can therefore trace the infinite chains of
reasoning required to deduce the contingent movements of the smallest mote of
dust.

Leibniz's position may be unconvincing to those who have abandoned belief in
a perfectly omniscient God and the traditional account of knowledge, but it was
a work of genius to find a way of satisfying those constraints. God alone can
have certain deductively founded knowledge of contingent facts, wheras we finite
mortals have to rely upon God's providence in arranging things according to a
causal pattern.  With that proviso in place however, we can rely upon the
necessity of the causal connections between our observations and external
reality to justify our beliefs. As a side effect of satisfying these
constraints, Leibniz produced an account of the justification of belief in
necessary truths by the analysis of their meanings, claimed that such analysis
could justify belief in all necessary truths (other than his <q>basic truths</q>
which supposedly stood in no need of justification) and provided a beautifully
clear explication of the metaphor on which modern philosophy would be built, the
notion of conceptual containment.

Leibniz was not the first to write of terms (or concepts) containing one
another. Peter of Abelard wrote of claims containing their consequences in the
12th century, and scholars debate whether the notion of claims containing their
consequences can be traced back as far as Boethius in the 6th century. He was,
however, the first to provide a clear interpretation for the metaphor.
Unfortunately he provided two very different, though aligned interpretations;
one linguistic and the other ontological.

In the linguistic version it is the relationship between a term and its
definition that is compared to the spatial relationship of containment. When, as
Leibniz described in the first quote above, a term is replaced by its
definition, it is 'opened up' and its metaphorical contents revealed (at least
in part). The key point being that a definition is synonymous with the term it
defines and hence such replacement preserves meaning.  If the result of such
replacement is a necessary <q>basic truth</q>, then the unexpanded original is
also a necessarily true. If knowledge of <q>basic truths</q> can be justified,
or they are so fundamental that no justification for them can be given or
reasonably required, then knowledge of all necessary truths that can be reduced
to <q>basic truths</q> by selectively revealing the contents of their terms can
also be justified.  This sense of containment, and the attendant account of our
knowledge of necessary truths, is as clear as the notion of synonymy which is
supposed to hold between terms and their definitions. 

In the ontological version of the metaphor it is the relationship between an
object and its properties and relations that is compared to spatial containment.
Leibniz was deeply committed to the Aristotelian principle that each meaningful
assertion has a single subject and a single predicate and either affirms or
denies that predicate of that subject((This already involves a confusion between use and mention - between subject as word and subject as object - which is a serious though remediable fault.  Leibniz, however, is careless of the distinction and the ambiguity is not immediately relevant to our current concerns.)). This is the form of sentences such as
<q>Jan is not happy</q> or <q>All women are mortal</q> (though in the first the
subject is individual and in the second it is universal).  Among its other
limitations, it is difficult to apply Aristotle's logic to sentences such as
<q>Mary is to the right of John</q> which, at least superficially, has two
subjects and expresses a relationship between them. Driven by a the procrustean
urge to make all statements fit within the limits of Aristotelian logic, Leibniz
sought to give a compatible account of the objects that make our statements
true. On this view each object <q>contains</q> within itself all the truth
makers for all the sentences of which that object is the subject. In order to
get a sense of this form of containment consider the sentence <q>Mary is to the
left of John</q>.  This can be coerced into subject-predicate form as
<q>Mary is John-leftward</q>((Or, of course as <q>John is Mary-rightward</q>. A devotee of Aristotelian logic might dismiss the choice between these alternatives as due to a defect in ordinary language.)).  If one takes subject-predicate form seriously,
this odd sentence concerns only Mary, and it must be something about Mary that
makes it true. On roughly these grounds, Leibniz held that each object <q>always
expresses within itself its relations to all others</q> ((Letter to De Bosses, [[local:zz.texts/leibniz1716.lettersAndPapers.pdf]])).  Indeed it is within
God's power to make <q>Mary is John-leftward</q> true without John existing, though
God would not do so <q>because he has decreed that all things should function
most wisely and harmoniously</q>((Letter to De Bosses, [[local:zz.texts/leibniz1716.lettersAndPapers.pdf|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Philosophical Papers and letters]])).  In this sense, according to Leibniz,
each object <q>contains</q> all its properties and relations.

Doctrines based upon these two metaphors would go on, eventually, to play a key
role in the origins of analytic philosophy. The first would inspire the central
doctrine of analytic philosophy: that belief in necessary truths is justified
solely by analysis of their meanings. The second would give rise to
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Doctrine_of_internal_relations&oldid=1154083324#cite_ref-1|the doctrine of internal relations]], whose rejection was a key rallying point of
early analytic philosophy. Before either of those developments, however, a far
more significant limitation or the assumption that all sentences are of
subject-predicate form would have to be recognized and overcome.

Earlier natural philosophers, most notably Descartes, grossly
underestimated the difficulty of providing a complete and true theory of the
physical world. At time writing as though they

concept was expressed by a unique symbol, formulae expressing necessary truths
could be identified by their syntax, and all sequences of valid reasoning could
be verified by mechanical calculation. Leibniz radically underestimated the
complexity of the inferences required in mathematical reasoning. His critics,
most notably Kant, correctly pointed out that the truths of mathematics and
geometry could not all be reduced to statements of identity (e.g. <q>0 = 0</q>,
or <q>All red things are red</q>)

In large part his metaphysical doctrines were the result
of his procrustean efforts to make all patterns of reasoning fit within the
limits of a logic based upon Aristotelian syllogisms and a rule for substituting
equals for equals - most notably the substitution of _definiens_ for

_definienda_ - which he borrowed from algebra.

This is not to suggest that Leibniz's views on language, reasoning and necessity

been one of the most prolific letter writers of the 17th century, corresponding

awareness of other philosophers. But it was easy to lump his fantastical claims

The idea that necessary truths could be discerned, and belief in the justified,
by means of the analysis of their meanings, and the expansion of definitions,

Although Leibniz was the first to suggest that necessary truths might be
discerned, and belief in them justified, by the analysis of their meanings, his
account of necessity still divereged sigfnificantly from his modern inheritors.

necessary truths can be reduced by unpacking their meanings. Replacing terms
with their definitions in which their meanings are more explicitly displayed

held that all truths were analytic, not just necessary truths, but that in
contingent truths the analyses could proceed infinitely some the analysis was of

==== hume ====
[[hume|Hume's]] avowed purpose in his [[local:zz.texts/hume1739.treatiseHumanNature.pdf|_Treatise of Human Nature_]] was to <q>introduce
the experimental method of reasoning</q> into the study of what is now called
human psychology. He does not, of course, stoop to perform any experiments, but
rather his intent is to develop a theory which is supported by observations of
human behaviour and thought in the same way that mechanistic physics was thought
to be supported by observations of natural phenomena.  In particular, Hume
claimed that our beliefs in casual relations are themselves caused by
psychological processes responding to causally efficacious (and hence
empirically accessible) properties such as contiguity, succession and
repetition. Those psychological processes, according to Hume, operated merely by
custom and habit rather than reasoning, and provide no justification for
confidence in the beliefs they produced.  Hence, among other things, <q>we
cannot give a satisfactory reason, why we believe, after a thousand experiments,
that a stone will fall, or fire burn</q>; and our beliefs concerning external
objects are caused by sensations rather than inferred from them: <q>belief is
more properly an act of the sensitive, than the cognitive part of our
natures</q>.

Though Hume is justly renowned as an empiricist and skeptic of causation, in his
most reflective and melancholy moods his skepticism extends far further. Just as
the empirical scientist's confidence in causation is itself caused, but not
justified by her observations of repeated succession, so too is the
mathematician's confidence in his proofs caused but not justified:
    Every time he runs over his proofs, his confidence encreases; but still more
    by the approbation of his friends; and is rais’d to its utmost perfection by
    the universal assent and applauses of the learned world. Now ’tis evident,
    that this gradual encrease of assurance is nothing but the addition of new
    probabilities, and is deriv’d from the constant union of causes and effects,
    according to past experience and observation.
Just as no experience is caused by a necessary connection between external
events, such as the striking of a billiard ball and its subsequent movement; so
too with our thoughts, we sense only that one thought comes after another and
not that there is a necessary connection between them.
[:Hume's positive account of belief formation by means of association does not
concern us here since it is only an account of how those beliefs are formed and
*not* of why they are justified:]

Hume's _Treatise_ is thus the first influential attempt to grapple with the
tension between the traditional account of knowledge and causal accounts of
belief formation. Hume claimed, somewhat unclearly and intermittently((as innovators and discoverers are wont to do)),
that if the formation of beliefs is a purely causal process, and like other
natural causal processes insensitive to modal relations, then we can
have no justification for believing in such modal relationships. In
particular no justification for believing there are <q>necessary connexions</q>
between causes and their effects. It is not, however, only beliefs in necessary
truths that are cast into doubt.  According to the traditional view, reasoning
is a process of forming beliefs in response to their modal connections. In
reasoning one infers a belief from others because one <q>sees</q> or somehow
discerns that it _must_ be true if those others are true.  If, on the one hand,
reasoning requires sensitivity to the modal connections between beliefs and the
justification of knowledge requires deriving that knowledge from principles
known with certainty by methods known to necessarily preserve truth, and on the
other hand, our beliefs are formed by causal processes that are utterly
insensitive to modal properties and relationships, then none of our beliefs are
produced by reasoning and none of our beliefs are knowledge.  Hume, at his most
skeptical, accepts something like this argument and concludes that our
understanding, which has led us to a causal understanding of our own minds,
<q>entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence in any
proposition, either in philosophy or common life. ... We have therefore, no
choice left but betwixt a false reason and none at all</q>.

=== kant ===
That Hume woke [[Kant]] from his <q>dogmatic slumbers</q> is a tired cliche,
but it is a tired cliche for good reason. The metaphor has the notable virtues
of being short, vivid, in Kant's own words and, not least importantly, true.
Where Hume had drawn attention to the conflict between naturalistic causal
theories of mind and traditional theories of knowledge and concluded that none
of our beliefs were knowledge, Kant claimed to reconcile the two and thereby
defend our claims to knowledge by the traditional standard.

The costs of Kant's proposed reconciliation were high. Gone was all
hope that the properties of objects were as our thoughts and experiences
represented them.  Gone too all hope of reason justifying substantive knowledge
of such objects. Indeed Kant decried the pursuit of knowledge of objects <q>as
they are in themselves</q> as the fundamental error that had prevented
metaphysics from entering <q>upon the secure path of a science</q> capable of
producing knowledge.  Not only was reason incapable of revealing any truth about
<q>things as they are in themselves</q>, but nothing could be known about them
whatsoever. The match between our experiences and our concepts (and the other
technical components of the content of judgements that Kant introduced) however,
could yet be guaranteed and known with certainty.

The dismissal of knowledge of <q>things in themselves</q> was integral to Kant's
reconciliation between our understanding of ourselves as both reasoning beings
and as causal systems. Kant acknowledged that causal principles postulated in
empirical scientific theories <q>which properly pertain to sensibility, do
actually threaten to expand the bounds of sensibility until they include
everything, thus threatening even to displace the pure (practical) use of
reason.</q>((Bxxv)) (i.e. when taken to apply to <q>things in themselves</q> causal
theories leave no place for the exercise of reasoning in determining our
behaviour); But he claimed that this conflict was an illusion, created by
failing to recognise that we can only be justified in believing there to be
causal relationships between <q>things as they appear to us</q>.  The question
of whether <q>I am free in my actions or, like other beings, am led by the hand
of nature and of fate</q> (i.e. whether I am, among other things, free to be
influenced by reason, or like other natural phenomena my actions are causally
determined by brute facts) was to be rejected as one of the unavoidable, but
unanswerable questions which seeks to transcend the bounds of reason and
experience by applying concepts that are properly only applicable to <q>things
as they appear to us</q> to <q>things as they are in themselves</q>:
    no contradiction arises when we think the same will in both these ways: in
    its appearance (i.e., in its visible acts), as conforming necessarily to
    natural law and as to that extent not free; yet on the other hand, qua
    belonging to a thing in itself, as not subject to that law, and hence as
    free.[[local:zz.texts/kant1787.critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_]]((Pluhar/href="Translation))"/g
We could not, of course, know ourselves to be free, anymore than we could know
any of our concepts to apply correctly to any <q>thing in itself</q>, but we
were not precluded from entertaining the possibility. So too we could still hope
that our beliefs were, at least sometimes, the product of reasoning.

Whether or not his proposed reconciliation is satisfactory, Kant completed the
[[#a curious inversion|curious inversion]] noted above.  Where Hume had focused on the lack
of justification for our beliefs about the contingent external world, Kant
focused explicitly on the justification for our beliefs in necessary synthetic
_a priori_ truths.  Kant clearly understood that if any of our beliefs
concerning the external world were to satisfy the traditional requirements for
knowledge, there must be necessarily true first principles in which certain
belief could be justified _without experience_ and from which the rest of our
knowledge could be deduced with the aid of experience.  The method of deduction
was that of Aristotelian syllogistic which (even if it was later found to be
incomplete) could, like the modern logics that supplanted it, be precisely
described in terms of the formal((or syntactical)) properties of sentences, and
by that standard was completely clear.  Hence, in Kant's view, the problem of
explaining the justification for our beliefs about the external world
amounted to finding the justification for believing in suitable necessary
_a priori_ principles. Where the traditional Aristotelian view had held the
active intellect to be a faculty for distilling universal properties from direct
encounters with their instances, Kant held reason to be <q>the faculty that
provides us with the principles of _a priori_ knowledge</q>((Critique of Pure Reason A11)). Where Aristotelian
first principles concerned the essential properties of external objects and were
learnt from experience, Kantian first principles were known independently of
experience, concerned the fundamental properties of the world
_as it appeared to us_, and reflected the perceptual and conceptual structure of
our minds rather than the modal structure of the world.

===== causes of rejection =====
[[kant|Kant's]] philosophy had not one, but two heydays, and at its height
its dominance among European philosophers rivalled Aristotle's hold on
European philosophers in the late middle ages. ????Indeed it was so widely accepted
that it spread beyond the narrow confines of professional philosophy and began
to influence other European social institutions, particularly in Germany.????  It is
an essentially conservative philosophy and part of its appeal to
non-philosophical authorities was that it provided a plausible defence for
continued belief in the traditional tenets of European religion and morality in
the face of scientific discoveries that appeared to leave no room for either.

There is no single reason why Kant's system eventually fell out of favour.  To
be sure, there were internal problems.  If causation were only a
relationship between <q>things as they appear to us</q>, and never between
<q>things as they are in themselves</q> then those unknowable totally non-mental
<q>things in themselves</q> could not be the causes of the experiences
representing them; and a version of Hume's concern that we had no justification
for believing that our experiences were caused by non-mental objects remained
unanswered after all.  While versions of this criticism led some influential
German philosophers (such as Fichte and Schopenhauer((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself#Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte)))
to reject Kant's notion of the <q>thing in itself</q>, it was far from a key factor.

A more tangible problem was that several of the principles Kant had claimed to
be necessary truths known with certainty and independently of any experience
were later rejected on the basis of empirical evidence.  In particular, Kant had
claimed that the structure of space and time must be Euclidean by virtue of
unalterable fundamental structures in the human mind.  By contrast, according to
Einstein's theory of general relativity space-time was curved and its geometry
utterly independent of any mind. The theory contained various predictions,
most notably concerning the bending of light around massive objects such as
stars, which were subsequently verified. Kant had also claimed that all events
we could experience must be caused deterministically by virtue of the systematic
structure that human understanding gave to our experiences. By contrast, quantum
mechanics made detailed and irreducibly probabilistic predictions about matters
such as the decay of radioactive particles and again those predictions were
repeatedly verified. Even if Kant's system could be modified to render it
compatible with these discoveries, the mere possibility of error in judging
the truth of these principles or even in judging whether or not they were
_a priori_, threw the foundations of Kant's system into doubt. While these
issues were more compelling than the technical problems within Kant's system,
they were still not a decisive factor.  The relevant empirical discoveries were
largely made after Kant's system had already fallen out of favour. To those who
had already rejected Kant's system they served only as the final nail in its
coffin, while the core of remaining believers were so committed that these
discoveries did little to change their minds.

As it turned out, however, it was a combination of two other factors which had
the most effect in displacing the systems developed by Kant and his followers:

The first was the failure of Kant and his followers to deliver on
their promise of a metaphysics that was <q>purified by critique, and estabished
once and for all</q>((ibid., Bxxv)).  One of the central claims of Kant's
_Critique of Pure Reason_ had been that it would put an end to those
<q>questions which, by the very nature of reason itself, it is not able to
ignore, but which as transcending all its powers, it is also not able to
answer</q>((Critique of Pure Reason, 1st edition, 1st page, 1st paragraph))  by demarcating the limits of human _a priori_ knowledge, making the
justification of our knowledge within those limits clear and putting aside
questions concerning matters beyond these limits as insoluble. Disputes between
metaphysicians were supposed to become as resolvable as disputes between
mathematicians and produce a growing body of established results.

It is clear why Kant _thought_ his new system's purified methodology would sweep
away all the old metaphysical disputes (either by determining the grounds for
resolving them or by judging them to be about <q>things as they are in
themselves</q> and hence irresolvable). The rejection of our capacity to have
any insight into the essential qualities of objects and properties as <q>they
are in themselves</q> is a central theme of his _Critique_. The claims to
knowledge in those irresolvable metaphysical disputes were supposed to rely upon
appeals to that capacity for their justification. Once the illusion that our
sensations and thoughts had the same properties as the objects they represented
was uncovered, and attempts to gain knowledge of <q>things as they are in
themselves</q> were put aside, metaphysics was supposed to finally <q>enter upon
the secure road of a science</q>.

It is even clearer, however, that nothing of the sort happened in practice. The
justifications offered for taking the intuitive sense of <q>seeing clearly and
distinctly</q> that a claim was necessarily true as grounds for believing it
certainly changed in the wake of Kant's Copernican revolution. What had
previously been attributed to insight into the essential nature of external
objects and properties gained through repeated experience, was now attributed to
insight into the psychological structures involved in the formation of belief
(e.g. the <q>form of all possible experience</q>) gained thorough
introspection. Kant had provided a new account of capacity to reason and
distinguish necessary truths but the new foundations of reasoning and modal
knowledge proved just as open to debate as the old.  The supposed ability to
detect necessary truths remained compelling to philosophers who felt it
directly, but incapable of resolving disputes between philosophers.  Regardless
of the technical merits or defects of Kant's system (which remain as disputed as
any metaphysical claim) it was absolutely clear that in practice, disputes over
supposedly necessary _a priori_ principles continued as vigourously and as
irresolvably as ever among those who sincerely and diligently attempted to
follow out Kant's system.

The other key factor was technical advances in mathematics and formal logic.
Doubts concerning our ability to discern necessary truths had spread to the
point that they began to affect mathematics.  As one might expect, the study of
non-Euclidean geometry was an active area of mathematical investigation well
before Einstein suggested that the geometry of physical space-time might be
non-Euclidean.  Stemming from ancient attempts to deduce
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate|Euclid's fifth postulate]] from the other four postulates (or first principles) of
Euclidean geometry, investigations began to be made into mathematical spaces in
which this postulate was replaced with various alternatives. In these
investigations, our visual imagination (which Kant had taken to provide the
ultimate grounds for geometrical truths) was no longer a reliable guide to
deductive consequence and questions of precisely which forms of inference were
allowable in mathematical proofs became increasingly pressing. Partly in
response to such concerns and partly to show that arithmetic was not reliant
upon Kantian intuitions Frege produced his _Begriffschrift_, the seminal text of
modern logic, in 1879.

There were certainly critics of Kant's metaphysics, and of the disputed
speculative theories his followers developed, before Frege's work became well
known.  In the mid-19th century these critics included popular exponents of
materialism, which denied the existence of non-physical objects, and positivism,
which held all knowledge to be about one's own sensations; but these
alternatives did not win wide acceptance among philosophers. Whatever its flaws,
Kant had attempted to draw a distinction between those claims where our reason
was on firm ground and provided knowledge (such as those of geometry) and those
where it led us astray and produced only metaphysical speculation. However much
critics might disagree with Kantian metaphysics, without a principled account
of our knowledge of necessary truths which provided grounds for rejecting the
wild speculations of Kant's followers, but was yet adequate to allow for our
knowledge of the truths of geometry((Now cast as concerning non-physical spaces.)) and mathematics, alternatives to Kantian
metaphysics appeared equally dependent on their proponents' intuitive
sense of necessity and no unified opposition developed.

<q>The new logic</q>, as its English speaking proponents tended to call it,
captured a far wider and more complex range of inferential patterns than the
traditional Aristotelian logic which Kant had declared to be <q>closed and
completed</q> just one hundred years earlier. The inadequacy of Aristotelian
logic for the inferences required in geometry had been one of the instigations
for the _Critique of Pure Reason_.  Since the truths of geometry could not be
purely logical truths, there must be extra-logical _a priori_ principles which
were true by virtue of irreducible modal relationships between the concepts they
contained((e.g. the relationship between the concept of a straight line, and that of the shortest distance between two points)), and the intricate system of the _Critique_ was constructed to explain
our knowledge of those principles.

By contrast, it was reasonable to hope that the new logic rigourously delinated
all the patterns of inference required for mathematics((including both Euclidean and non-Euclidean goemetry)).  Vindicating that hope
was the chief purpose of Russell and Whitehead's _Principia Mathematica_ which,
for a time after its publication in 1910, was regarded as one of the great
intellectual achievements of the 20th century.  Russell and Whitehead took the
sentences of their system of symbolic logic to be expressing the propositions of
mathematics in explicit notation. The apparent success of their system raised
hopes that the new logical notation could explicitly express the ultimate, but
hidden, structure of the meanings of all the sentences of ordinary langauge.
Once this <q>logical structure</q> was made fully explicit, valid inferences and
necessary truths could be distinguished by their syntax.

With a new and seemingly rigourous way of distinguishing between metaphysical
speculation and the solid reasoning exemplified in mathematics, the old Kantian
explanation of our knowledge of necessary truths could finally be abandoned
completely. In place of Kant's explanation of necessity in terms of irreducible
modal relationships between our concepts, the necessity of statements was now
attributed to the <q>logical structure</q> of their meanings. A logical
structure that could be known by the speakers of the relevant language who
presumably knew, or could figure our, the meanings of their statements.

Though Kant's philosophy has lost its dominant position among Anglo-European
philosophers it still retains some adherents((Indeed for reasons discussed ???>below<??? there has been a recent resurgence in Kant's philosophy.)).  Kant's most
significant lasting influence, however, is the major sociological landmark of
modern philosophy. The divide between continental and analytic philosophy
is between those who, on broadly Kantian grounds, continue to take introspective
awareness of their mental states as a source of knowledge about the necessary
features of the world, and those seek to place tighter, publicly discernable
limits on the claims of reason, in order to deliver on Kant's promise of a
philosophy freed from irresolvable disputes. The former remained closer to the
older humanistic understanding of ourselves, maintain the ambitions of
philosophy to answer seemingly profound  and held that science was at best a partial description of
the world.

???? CUTTINGS FROM EARLIER vvv
For their part, early Analytic philosophers thought Kant's account of
_analyticity_, which had relied upon traditional Aristotelian theories of
semantics((This is discussed in more detail [[????|below]])), was too limited.  A range of technical developments in formal logic
had made it plausible that the class of analytic truths included statements of a
variety and complexity that had previously seemed impossible. In light of these
developments Analytic philosophers hoped Kant's account of our knowledge of
analytic truths could be expanded and developed into an account of all
our knowledge of necessary truths. Although disputes over various accounts of
analyticity and the nature of the objects to be analysed were among the
movement's main activities((it was commonly agreed that these objects either were or were related to the meanings of linguistic expressions)), in the movement's early optimistic period its
members were at least superficially unified by a general commitment to the maxim
<q>All necessary truths are analytic</q>.

Analytic philosophy is the third and last of the movements since the 12th
century to achieve such dominance among Anglo-European philosophers as to
comprise an orthodoxy. Unlike the preceeding Aristotelian and Kantian movements
which were largely named and deliniated by their opponents in hindsight, many
analytic philosophers explicitly identified themselves as such.  While the
founding figures of analytic philosophy naturally predated the the movement's
name((just as christ was not a christian)), by the middle of the twentieth century there were a multitude of
conferences, journals and university departments specifically catering to
<q>analytic</q> philosophy.  Hence, the extent of the movement's membership
is comparatively clear, as is the fact that many of those members saw themselves
and their peers as pursuing a distinctively different form of philosophy; one
that was more narrowly circumscribed, but set on a firmer footing and freed (it
was hoped) from the irresoluble speculation that had marred its predecessors.

Another key difference is that analytic philosophy is named for a method,
<q>analysis</q> of meanings, rather than a founding figure.  The method of
<q>analysis</q> was supposed to be the only way in which necessary truths could
be discerned and certain belief in them be justified; in brief, <q>All necessary
truths are analytic</q>. The agreement this slogan generally elicited was, of
course, largely nominal. Disputes over whether the meanings to be analysed were
thoughts, facts, propositions, concepts, public sentences, or something else
altogether, perhaps a circuitous way of talking
about linguistic norms, became one of the movement's central activities
and no specific account of meanings or the means by which they might be analysed
ever commanded general acceptance.  Despite these differences however, there was
widespread agreement that <q>analysis</q> was the only fundamental way in which
belief in necessary truths could be justified((Of course derivative forms of justification, such as being told by a someone else who had conducted the requisite analysis, were of course recognized)), and was hence the foundation of
our ability to reason.

The reason for Analytic Philosophy's popularity((among English speaking philosophers)) is also comparatively
explicit. It offered hope of a naturalistic account of our knowledge of
necessary truths. At the start of the movement the demand for a
naturalistic account was perhaps chiefly motivated by more or less empiricist
scruples against non-experiential sources of knowledge; as the movement
progressed some analytic philosophers placed greater emphasis on reconciliation
with scientific accounts of the world and belief formation. Both motives
(insofar as they are distinguishable) would be satisfied by a linguistic account
of the foundations of necessary truth that analytic philosophy promised.
accounts of the justification of knowledge of necessary truths.

It is, to put it mildly, very plausible that learning a langauge is both a
causal and empirical process.  We certainly appear to learn to speak and
understand natural languages by observing our linguistic elders, attending to
their feedback on our performances, and practicing with our peers; in doing so
we have experiences which, when things go well, cause us to become competent
speakers of the language in question.  If, as most analytic philosophers
believed (like the Kantians and Aristotelians before them) learning a language
consisted in learning the meanings of public expressions (perhaps the thoughts
or concepts they express) and the meanings of necessary truths have some
distinctive discernable property, then our capacity to distinguish necessary
truths can be explained without appealing to an unnatural power of intuitive
insight into necessity. Of course, the chief problem was not to explain our
ability to merely _discern_ necessary truths but to explain our _knowledge_ of
them, but here too, it seemed plausible that an appeal to meanings offered a
solution.

Attempts to justify knowledge of necessary truths by appeal to definitions
had been made long before analytic philosophy. The title of the first section
of Euclid's _Elements_, has been translated into English as <q>Definitions</q>
since the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Billingsley#Translation_of_Euclid|first English translation of the <cite>Elements</cite>]] in 1570, and
principles under that title are given as justification for inferences in the
_Elements_ subsequent geometrical proofs. The original Greek title <q>Όριο</q>,
however, may be more literally translated as as <q>boundary</q> or <q>limit</q>
and several of the definitions offered under that title are more akin to
fundamental principles or statements of objects' essential properties than
linguistic stipulations (much like the definitions sought after in Socratic
dialogues). The sharp distinction between definitions and essences is
fundamentally foreign to ancient European philosophy since, as noted
above, it was generally held that the concepts that were the meanings of our
words were the same as the properties of the objects around us and hence there
was no distinction to be drawn between sentences that were true by definition
and sentences that were true. But it was Leibniz 


assumed that
our conceptsthough it has its precursors in the
mediaval distinction between has some precursors So too, though Hume claimed that
thewords were ideas, and, in his more sanguine moods meanings of words were
ideas, and, in his more sanguine moods matters of fact 

Kant, and before him Locke, had recognized a class of statements that were true

Again the claim that _some_ necessary truths are true by definition long
predated
f What distinguished analytic philosophy was not the appeal to meanings and
definitions as giving rise to necessary truths, but the claim that _all_
necessary truths were true purely by virtue of their meanings.

The centrality anaalytic philosophers ascribed to the role of meanings in
explaining our knowledge of necessary
truths account
led philosophers to seek a more rigourous account of meanings.
As the movement progressed

At first success in the development of formal notations

the early optimism that had marked its beginning
faded. A plausible account of meanings, how their representational content was
fixed, and how we had knowledge of them, proved far more elusive than had been
expected. As the earlier accounts of meaning were found to be unsatisfactory new
accounts were offered, each with a correspondingly altered explication of the
claim that all necessary truths were true purely by virtue of their meanings. At
the outset of the movement however, the sense of this claim, and its
justification was clear. It was supposed to be a consequence of two more
fundamental principles.  The first was that all _logical_ truths were true
purely by virtue of their meaning. The second was that all necessary truths were
either explicit or inexplicit logical truths. One way to understand the appeal
of these principles, and the notion of logical truth upon which they relied is
by considering their application to concrete examples.

==== logical truths true by meaning alone ====
The first of the principles which were taken to support the claim that
logical truths are true by virtue of meaning alone was the compositionality of
meaning.

Consider the sentence
    (1) It is raining and today is Friday.
If one grants the fundamental claim that the capacity to use and understand
public languages depends upon the meanings of the expressions in those
langauges, then it difficult to deny that the meaning of (1) is a
structural composition of the meaning of
    (2) It is raining
and:
    (3) Today is Friday.
I.e., That the meaning of (1) is the meanings of (2) and (3) combined <q>in the
conjunctive way</q>, whatever that turns out to be. This claim seems so obvious
that it was taken somewhat for granted by some analytic philosophers. Perhaps if
pressed to defend the claim they might point out that the only notations

early analytic philosophers' belief in this claim was that notations, such as
Frege's _Begriffschrift_ had this structure and

is so plausible is that it is part of a compositional semantics which explains
our ability to compose and understand novel sentences in terms of our
understanding of the familiar parts from which, and forms of compositions by
which, they are composed (and, at least for the moment, we are granting the
assumption that to understand a sentence is to be is some sort of successful
relationship with its meaning).

Another plausible principle of common-sense semantics that analytic philosophers
drew upon is that that the meaning of a sentence determines the conditions under
which that sentence is true. Sometimes, as in
Bertrand Russell's 
[[local:zz.texts/russell1905.onDenoting.pdf|<cite>On denoting</cite>]] 
the best known
short paper of early analytic philosophy,
this principle is simply taken for granted, at other times as in Frege's

for a sentence's meaning either is, or determines, how it
represents the world (or some part of it) as being, and if the world is as a
sentence represents it to be then that sentence is true((This is not intended to
express commitment for a correspondance theory of truth, but only to connect our ordinary
claims about the relation of representing to our claims about truth.)).
If this account of meaning is flawed, many philosophers were prepared to simply
defin <q>cognitive meaning</q> in such a way that 


Whatever the merits of this general principle, it 
In this particualr case, it is plausible
that the result of composing two meanings together <q>in the
conjunctive way</q> is the meaning of a sentence that is true if and only if
both of its conjuncts is true.  So too, it seemed plausible to suppose that the
meaning of the sentence *'Today is not Friday'* contains the meaning of '*Today
is Friday'* <q>in the negated way</q>, whatever that turns out to be, and any
meaning that contains another meaning (directly) <q>in the negated way</q> is
the meaning of a sentence that is true if and only if the meaning it contains
<q>in the negated way</q> is the meaning of a sentence that is false. But now if
these two operations are combined to produce the meaning of the sentence *'Today
is Friday and Today is not Friday'* the result is the meaning of a sentence that
is necessarily false. For, by virtue of the combinatorial structure of its
meaning, this last sentence is true if and only if both *'Today is Friday'* is
true and *'Today is not Friday'* is true, and by virtue of its meaning
containing *'Today is Friday'* <q>in the negated way</q>, *'Today is not
Friday'* is false if *'Today is Friday'* is true. By the same token, the
sentence is also *analytically false*, since contemplation of the structure of
its meaning is enough to justify the belief that it is false. Finally the only
possibility of error in this judgement is being mistaken about the structure of
the relevant meaning, in which case one is really talking or believing something
about a different meaning altogether and hence one is justified in being
absolutely confident that *'Today is Friday and today is not Friday'* is false.


Now in the case of <q>Today is Friday and Today is not Friday</q>

=two steps
== all logical truths are true by virtue of meaning
== all necessary truths are reducible, by analysis, to logical truths

It seems that this definition also gives rise to other statements that are true
by definition, even though they do not


Now in the case just considered, the appeal to meanings is doubly superfluous.
In the first place it does not provide any greater justification for believing
So too for all the logical terms, <q>and</q>, 

= demorgan and boole (later whitehead)
generalisation of algebraic laws to apply to non quantitative relations

this doctrine of the linguistic basis of logical truth did not spring full grown
from the brow of Frege or Russell, it was the process of long development from
logicians such as for a term to have a particular meaning just is for the
inferences containing that term to ful fill certain formal rules.

= reveal already effective justification/structure
Now in the case just considered, the appeal to meanings is doubly superfluous.
It does not provide any greater justification for believing *'Today is Friday
and today is not Friday'* to be false than we had already. But to judge the
account negatively on this account is to mistake its motivation.

The claims for <q>analysis</q> were not so grand

<q>Analysis</q> was not supposed to provide us with new and better justification
for logical principles

It was not that ancient geometers beliefs in the conclusions of their proofs had
been unjustified until analytic philosophers had analysed their claims. But
rather that it provided an explanation of how we were sensitive to such
justifications.
Analysis revealed what it was that the unphilosophically minded but
linguistically competent layman was responding to all along (or that she was
using her terms in a different way and hence dispute as to the necessity of a
claim .

The person who had learnt no analytic philosophy does not have any less
justification for believing a truth to be necessary than a specialised academic
philosopher. Nor do they gain some justification

there are these structured entities called meanings, and that either meanings or

all this had been accepted by Kantian philosophy that was it predecessor
but even on its own terms there were problems: the reconciliation with science
was only achieved on the optimistic, but inherently unjustifiable belief that
the scientific image was partial, that the world <q>as it was in itself</q> was
beyond scientific description and in particular it could not be established that
we acted as a result of reasoning.

But under Kant the patterns of reasoning relied upon in geometry and arithmetic 
had seemed too complex??

Symbols such as concrete inscriptions, patterns of illumination, vocable blasts,
varying electrical voltages are causally efficacious physical objects of the
first order. If meanings were somehow mental or neurological counterparts of
symbols, then reasoning could be explained as a causal process of manipulating
those symbols akin to producing a proof in a formal system of logic.

Frege's apparent success in capturing the truths of arithmetic and geometry as
theorems

The appeal of this account of our knowledge of 
Analytic philosophy was inspired by early
apparent success in producing a
notation in which valid inferences required to deduce the truths of
arithmetic and geometry could be distinguished by

their complex syntactic (i.e. non-semantic and causal) properties.

Technical developments in logic raised the hope of devising a notation in which
each concept was denoted by a distinct symbolic pattern.

If the meanings of our statements were somehow akin to the formulae in such an
ideal notation then reasoning and are capacity to distinguish necessary truths
might be explained as the result of causal processes of manipulating the mental
or neurological counterparts of symbols.
(or the product of liguistic norms and practices)

and roles they played in our interactions

but still, whether they were norms of a sort that could be fulfilled or breached

by Frege.

Still the appeal of the approach is manifest is there were a structural feature
of the causal properties of these things (if they were things at all) that
either were, or were expressed by, 

At the time it was perhaps scruples against unempirical sources of
knowledge such as Kantian intuitions, divine revelation or .

all the truths of arithemetic and geometry might be distinguished by
their syntactic (i.e. causal) properties.

If there were somethinng akin to that notation, then perhaps reasoning
might be explained

in which each concept was denoted by a distinct symbolic pattern

and when expressed in that perspicacious notation the truths of arithmetic and
geometry might be distinguished by their syntactic (i.e. causal) properties.
Although the hopes of a reconcilation with a naturalistic theory of mind 

the Kantian orthodoxy that it superceeded, it has at its core an account of our
capacity to reason and our knowledge of necessary truths.

Indeed an a analytic truth was simply a statement whose truth could be
determined by analysis without recourse to empirical observation.

and as such was a property to which we could have epistemic access and which
could influence the causal process of belief formation.

appeal of this approach are straightforward. The structure
of sentences, or the supposed structure of their meanings, are epistemically
accessible. Just as our experiences are caused by external objects and can give
us reason for believing in them, so too our mental states can causally interact
with sentences and their meanings. The learning of langauge is, afater all a
causal process



= just what these entities were was unclear
Frege, among many others, held that the objects to 
Russell at various times thoughts that meanings were mental entities such as
thoughts, or mind independent propositions that had concrete objects such as the
Eifel tower aogst their constituents.

and hence that the only way in which knowledge might be acquired without
experiene was my means of the analysis of meanings

That knowledge of necessary truths can only be justified by the analysis of their
meanings.

If either meanings are symbols, or are something akin to symbols, and just as
logical truths can be identified by their syntactic structure

Wheras kant's account had only offered us the capacity to hope that our
decisions were guided by reason, that there was no contradiction between our
appearances


==== frege ====
Frege's claims concerning linguistic meaning are not merely of historical
interest. They continue to influence and inform the philosophy of langauge to
the current day. By and large, however, his views on linguistic meaning have
been rejected and superceeded.  During his lifetime Frege's theory of arithmetic
was found to give rise to devastating contradictions, and in the end he returned
to the Kantian account of our knowledge of geometry and arithmetic that he had
spent his life rejecting. Thus nearly all of Frege's opinons 
However, though nearly all his philosophical opinions were rejected
his philosophy is at the core 
-
More than anything else, analytic philosophy was the product of a technological
breakthrough. That technology was first developed by Freg. Regardless of the
fate of the philosophical positions it was used to support Frege's achievement
will always be one of the key landmarks of human intellectual history.

Although Frege's motivation was rigour, rather than automation, the individual
steps permitted in his system of logic are so precisely defined that they can be
performed by causal systems responding to the physical properties of the symbols
they manipulate, or in other words, they can be performed by computers. It is
not, however, the rigour of Frege's system that sets it apart from earlier
logical systems but its complexity. The system of logic Frege specified in his
_Begriffschrift_ is the first system of symbol manipulation to reach the level
of complexity achieved by modern computer processors. More technically, Frege's
system is the first to be able to capture [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computably_enumerable_set|computably enumerable]] sets of formulae
as theorems. This level of complexity is one of the fundamental orienting
landmarks of the field of computational complexity. It is not a transient
boundary that can be surpassed by adding more memory or multiple processors but
reflects the fundamental principles for composing complex computational
processes from simpler ones. Although higher levels of complexity have been
contemplated as mathematical curiosities, no physical process has yet been
harnessed to perform computations at a higher level of complexity and it may be
the case that none ever will. Even [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation#Quantum_models|quantum computing]], at least in its currently
projected models, would only allow tasks to be completed more quickly and using
a handful of <q>q-bits</q> in the place of a polynomially greater amount of
non-quantum computer memory, but not lift us beyond the level of complexity
achieved by Frege's humble notation. To our current knowledge, Frege's system
marks the maximal boundary of the complexity of our theories of the world.  No
known pattern of human reasoning, in any field of enquiry (including
mathematics, and physics) transcends this boundary.

At the centre of Frege's 
one was the integration

The truly innovative component 
The bountiful complexity of Frege's system is due to the combination of his
If there is some complex inference which involving a 

A sentence of a given form could occur in several different types of syllogism
syllogisms.
e.g. Even though the following two syllogisms are of different types, the
sentence <q>All men are mortal</q> is a premise of both of them.

    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | All humans are mortal.<br>All mortals are ignorant.<br>&therefore; All humans are ignorant. | All humans are mortal.<br>Some humans are fools.<br>&therefore; Some mortals are fools |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

But each individual sentence realises only one form, and each type of syllogism
is identified (and named) for the unique triple of sentence forms that compose
it.  Instances of the syllogism type named B_a_rb*a*r_a_ _apple_ *apple*, such as the
first of the two examples above for instance, are composed of three type A, or
universal affirmative sentences (i.e. sentences of the form <q>All ... are

there is a puzzling difficulty in Frege's work that 
[[Wittgenstein]], whose _Tractatus Logico Philosophicus_ was the book that
launched the movement. Here it was the relationship between symbols 

Frege cannot say that something is a concpet, nor can he say taht something is
not a concept not that somerthign is not an object (p.166) but he can show that
something is  concept (AAx)(C(x) = True or C(x) = False)
these things can be said or shown

Frege's ambition, was to show that his sytem of logic could capture all
necessary inferences in any field whatsoever. No necessary connections between
concepts. If, for example AAx(If Red(x) then Coloured(x)), then that could not
be because of some necessary connection between . all necessasry truths are due
to logical complexity and not tude to necessary relations betwene <q>atomic</q>

were not intermediaries between physical representations and

If Frege's goal of capturing all deductive inferences/necessry connections (see
Frege book)
Wittgenstein took Frege's independence of concepts and raised it to become the
sole criteron by which the fundamental or atomic propositions were to be
identified. If all necessary truths are disguised truths of logic then the
fundamental concepts

by vitrue of the syntactic manipulations that we are disposed to perform (early
wittgenstein) that our expressions represent (are true under) the range of
states of affairs that they do.

Or meanings are structured entities that have properties and structures and
because we are sensitive to those features (just as formal systems are sensitive
to the syntactic properties of their wffs) that we are disposed to make the
inferences that we do (Russell? sets of possibel worlds

was it becasue of the structured mapping from syntactic forms/wffs/sentences to
meanings that some sentences were mapped to the vacuous meaning, the tautology
meaning. Or was it because we held some sentence forms, to be acceptable or
unacceptable (possible or impossible)
