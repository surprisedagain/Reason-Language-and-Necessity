    success any speculation on the subject. But, in fact, this distinction is
    one that can hardly fail to be at once understood. It is insisted upon by
    almost all the best modern, as well as ancient, metaphysicians, as of
    primary importance. And if any person does not fully apprehend, at first,

    geometry, or the properties of numbers, so as to obtain a familiar

  = the collapse of traditional European accounts of reasoning =
Roughly four hundred years have passed since European philosophers had an
account of reasoning compatible with their understanding of the world
around them. Just over two generations have passed since the collapse of the
last great philosophical research program devoted to producing an account of
reasoning compatible with well-supported modern scientific theories. 
Once, this conflict between our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings
and our understanding of the world around us was thought to be absolutely
intolerable, but sheer time and repeated failure have rendered it unexceptional.
In order to rouse ourselves from the numbing effects of failure and familiarity,
let us begin by recalling rosier days when our theories of the world and our
theories of our capacity to reason were compatible.

Long ago, it was thought to be clear why reasoning led us to truth. Our minds
contained concepts, and these concepts were the same as, or at least very
similar to, the properties of the objects around us. (Perhaps in something like
the way that an object and its impression in a clay tablet are similar.) Maybe
these concepts were imprinted in our minds through our senses, or maybe they
were perfect forms of which physical properties were imperfect copies. But in
either case there was a consonance between our concepts and the properties of
the objects around us. The sensation felt when touching a flame was thought to
be identical to the heat which caused the flame to burn. The weight felt when
lifting a stone identical to the weight in the stone which caused it to resist
being pushed; and the color seen when looking at a white patch of snow identical
to the snow's whiteness. Because of these direct encounters with objects'
properties we could intuit the fundamental necessary principles that governed
them. 

A corollary of this view was the belief that knowledge, at least in its best
and purest form, is produced by starting with first principles known with
certainty and deriving consequences from them by deductive methods that are
absolutely guaranteed to preserve truth. Perhaps only an infinite and
omniscient intellect such as the Christian God's could determine the necessity
of the arrangement of the material world around us; but even limited intellects
such as ours could determine which combinations of properties were possible or
impossible by examining which combinations of concepts we could conceive of
<q>clearly and distinctly</q> (as Descartes frequently put it((The phrase <q>clare & distincte</q> occurs thirteen times in his [[local:zz.texts/descartes2-philosophicalWritings.pdf|_Meditations on First Philosophy_]]))&zwj;). Combinations of
properties that we could not conceive despite our familiarity with them, such
as would be realised by round squares, triangles whose internal angles did
not sum to two right angles, or objects that were both completely red and
completely green, were impossible.

The pre-eminent example of knowledge, according to this view (and hence for most
of European intellectual history from Aristotle to Hume) was geometry.
Geometry taken not as we now understand it: an investigation of various
non-physical mathematical idealisations; but as the ancients understood it: an
investigation into the spatial properties of the physical objects around us.
Geometry was the exemplary demonstration of the power of reason. It was taken to
show that reason, perhaps based upon concepts of lines and circles imprinted in
us by experience, but otherwise unaided by experiment and observation, could
produce substantial knowledge of the necessary structure of the world.  There
were, of course, famous ancient skeptics, but they tended to focus on the
fallibility of the senses; and their criticisms tended to amount to noting that
the justifications for our beliefs about the external world did not reach the
standard set by geometry. Rather than challenging the classical theory of
knowledge, ancient skeptics simply insisted that nothing fulfilled it.

Around the start of the 17th century, European philosophers began to note the
cracks heralding the long, gradual collapse of these accounts of knowledge and
reasoning. There is, of course, no exact date on which the collapse began and
it is, as yet, incomplete.  Initially, awareness of problems in the traditional
accounts of knowledge and reasoning spread piecemeal, and when they were noted
they did not immediately give rise to despair, but to attempts to repair or
resolve them. The death-knell of the ancient account of reasoning might
reasonably be said to have been struck in 1919, when decisive empirical evidence
was gathered confirming Einstein's theory that physical space was not Euclidean.
But though it became generally accepted that the geometry of physical space is
neither Euclidean, nor capable of being known _a priori_, the traditional
account of reasoning still retained devoted adherents((See [[local:zz.texts/chisholm1966-truthsOfReason.pdf]] – particularly chapter 5)). Even
today, obdurate remnants of the traditional account limit the range of accounts
of reasoning considered worthy of serious attention.  Still, the traditional
accounts' fall from orthodoxy is clear.  These accounts of knowledge and
reasoning had once been more widely accepted among European scholars than any
modern philosophical theory((<q>Until Descartes, _all_ theories that explained perception as involving some kind of representation claimed that the representation _resembles_ what it represents. Whether the representation is in the sense organ, soul or mind, it is similar to the thing represented in that it instantiates a property which is like, or literally the same as, the represented property.</q><br> [[local:zz.texts/benYami2015-descartesPhilosophicalRevolution.pdf]]<br>See also [[local:zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/adriaenssen2017-representationScepticismAquinasToDescartes.pdf]])), but by the middle of the 20th century
English-speaking philosophers largely, though not completely, dismissed them as
ancient errors.

The key cause of the collapse of confidence in these ancient accounts of
knowledge and reasoning, was the undeniable increase in scientific knowledge.
This knowledge posed two distinct and fundamental problems for the traditional
accounts:

== first problem: the justification of scientific theories ==
While the principles of Aristotelian physics were perhaps neither so precise nor
known with the same certainty as principles of geometry, it was not preposterous
to cast them as being like geometrical principles in being necessarily true
and known with greater certainty than the observable consequences derived
from them. Like geometrical principles, physical principles could be held
to be made true by the essential natures of the objects and properties they
concerned. On this view, the Aristotelian principle that heat rises, for
instance, is not an empirical generalisation, but an essential aspect of the
nature of heat. An aspect that may be grasped, by a mind capable of
contemplating general laws, in a flash of cognition after repeatedly observing
hot objects. The new scientific laws, however, could not be made to fit into
this mold.

At every point, the fundamental generalisations at the core of modern
scientific theories are unlike necessary first principles grasped with certainty
in a flash of insight by a reasoning mind after repeatedly sensing the relevant
properties.

==== not sensible properties ====
To begin with, many of the properties ascribed to objects in scientific
generalisations are utterly unlike those met with in human experience.
Aristotle had been prepared to postulate bodies too small to be sensed directly;
but the qualities he attributed to them were akin to the ordinary sensible
qualities of wet and dry, hot and cold.  By contrast, human sensory organs are
not sensitive to properties such as electric field strength, quantum spin or
quantum color (and if we can sense magnetic fields, our capacity is so
rudimentary as to be debatable((See Wang et al., [[https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0483-18.2019|_Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from Alpha-Band Activity in the Human Brain_]], 2019))&zwj;).

Even attributions of properties such as wavelength and mass, which might be
thought to be sensible, are often at odds with ordinary sensations.  The
mass of an object, for example, is unlike its felt weight in that the latter is
dependent upon gravity (or the seemingly distinct constant acceleration) wheras
the former remains unchanged even in micro-gravity. Thus even though we sense
something commonly correlated with mass (perhaps the force exerted on our
bodies when we support objects unaided) it seems we do not sense the mass of
objects.

==== not necessary truths ====
Another difference is that scientific generalisations are not thought to be
true necessarily.  This claim's most influential advocate may be Popper, for
though he did not argue for it explicitly, it is implied by his well known
principle that scientific claims must be falsifiable.  According to
Popper(([[https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t9x174f7h|The Logic of Scientific Discovery]], 1959)), a statement is falsifiable if and only if there is a possible <q>basic
statement</q> (i.e. a singular existential claim, such as <q>The needle on this
voltmeter is pointing to 11</q>) whose truth is <q>intersubjectively
testable</q> (i.e.  about which observers can come to agree despite other
differences in their beliefs) and with which that statement is incompatible.
But of course, necessary truths are compatible with every <q>basic statement</q>
and hence, by Popper's standard, no scientific principle is necessary.

Independently of Popper's standard for scientific enquiry, principles such as
the right hand rule governing the movement of charged particles through
magnetic fields have obvious symmetric alternatives that appear to be equally
plausible _a priori_ and yet mutually exclusive. While other principles, such as
<q>Elements with eight electrons in their outer shell are inert</q> seem too
palpably arbitrary to be considered necessary.

In the other direction, while we may now be confident that Newtonian mechanics
is false, it is at least not obvious that it is necessarily false((However see Xia, [[https://doi.org/10.2307/2946572|_The Existence of Non-Collision Singularities in Newtonian Systems_]], 1992));
and if Newtonian mechanics is not necessarily false then no scientific theory 
incompatible with it can be necessarily true.

==== not known with certainty ====
Popper formulated his falsification principle in the mid 20th century, but
Descartes had recognized that scientific claims gained credence
via their success in predicting observations before 1650((see [[local:zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritings.pdf|_Principles of Philosophy_]] (1644) §206: <br><q>Suppose for example that someone wants to read a letter written in Latin but encoded so that the letters of the alphabet do not have their proper value, and he guesses that the letter B should be read whenever A appears, and C when B appears, i.e. that each letter should be replaced by the one immediately following it. If, by using this key, he can make up Latin words from the letters, he will be in no doubt that the true meaning of the letter is contained in these words. It is true that his knowledge is based merely on a conjecture, and it is conceivable that the writer did not replace the original letters with their immediate successors in the alphabet, but with others, thus encoding quite a different message; but this possibility is so unlikely <especially if the message contains many words> that it does not seem credible.  Now if people look at all the many properties relating to magnetism, fire and the fabric of the entire world, which I have deduced in this book from just a few principles, then, even if they think that my assumption of these principles was arbitrary and groundless, they will still perhaps acknowledge that it would hardly have been possible for so many items to fit into a coherent pattern if the original principles had been false.</q><br> That our belief in such claims is justified by their fit specifically with <q>things manifest to the senses</q> is made clear in the section immediately before this quote.)). For several
centuries afterwards, it was only dimly apprehended(:By everyone apart, perhaps, from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes|Reverend Thomas Bayes]]:) that for an
experience to give credence to a hypothesis, there must be other possible
experiences which would confute it (hence Popper's emphasis on falsification);
but it _was_ widely understood that belief in scientific theories was justified
by their success in predicting observations and that they were
_not deducible from_ reports of those observations.

There are thus two sources of uncertainty built into the foundations of our
knowledge of scientific truths. Firstly our observations are subject to error,
we may see the needle on the voltmeter pointing to 11 when in fact it is
pointing to 10. Secondly even if our observations are correct, they do not
_guarantee_ the truth of the general scientific principles they support.
The principles of scientific theories are not deducible from the observations
that support them.  Any universal principle in which belief is only justified by
repeated observation of positive instances may yet be false, no matter how many
positive instances are observed.  Hence, at least according to the traditional
theory of knowledge, our observations cannot justify believing such principles
with absolute certainty.

==== known less certainly than their consequences ====
Another point of difference between scientific laws and Aristotelian first
principles, is that scientific laws are known with less certainty than the
particular cases fulfilling them; wheras geometrical and arithmetic laws are
known with greater certainty than the particular cases that they subsume.

Most of us, for instance, are more confident that addition is symmetric (i.e.
that for any pair of numbers _n_ and _m_, _n_ + _m_ = _m_ + _n_) than that
38974298435982 + 87248912374 = 87248912374 + 38974298435982. A modern view may
ascribe our uncertainty as to the truth of the latter to the difficulty of
determining whether the particular case presented falls under the general rule
(i.e. whether, among other things, the sixth digit of the first number in the
equation just given is the same as the sixth digit in the last). Plato, by
contrast, relied upon a looser and more complex relationship between ordinary
objects and the forms than instantiation _simpliciter_, holding that ordinary
objects realise forms only imperfectly((See the discussion of geometrical figures in [[local:zz.texts/chisholm1966-truthsOfReason.pdf]] for a modern exposition of the view.:)). This shortcoming meant that ordinary
sensible objects might fail to fulfill the laws obtaining between the forms they
instantiated. In either case the general law is more certain that its
exemplification in any given instance.

By contrast, scientific generalisations – even mundane ones such as <q>Blue
litmus paper turns red when immersed in acid</q> – are known with less certainty
than particular observations of their instances. Indeed on modern views it
follows from fundamental principles of probability that the probability assigned
to such generalizations in our best theories must be less than probability
assigned to the observation of any particular positive instance. For the
falsehood of any instance renders a universal claim false, and hence the
probability of any universal claim must be at least as low as the probability of
it being (or having been) fulfilled in any particular case.

==== not intuitable as a result of observation ====
The final point of difference, which is also the most difficult to make sense of
from the modern viewpoint, is that scientific laws are not grasped in a flash of
insight after repeated sensation. After repeated encounters with circles some
genius might, in a sudden insight, realise that each is a set of points
equidistant from a centre. After repeated encounters with lines, one may realise
that just one straight line passes through any pair of distinct points. But one
does not, after repeatedly lifting heavy objects, suddenly realise that the
gravitational constant is 6.6743 +/- 0.00015 x 10^-11^ Newton square meters per
square kilogram.

=== consequences of these differences ===
The differences just noted make it clear that our knowledge of scientific
generalisations is not justified in the way prescribed by the traditional
accounts of knowledge and reasoning. The hold of those traditional views on
modern minds is so tenacious, however, that rather than rejecting them, the
first manifestation of the dawning realisation that much of our knowledge is not
justified in this way is often skepticism.

So it was for Descartes. Though he claimed his skepticism was merely
methodological, the starting point of his _cogito_ was the realisation that
our theories of the external world cannot be deduced from observations and
necessary first principles, and hence our knowledge of them is dubious.  This
doubt became known as <q>Cartesian skepticism</q> and became a
central problem of early modern philosophy(:As Kant put it, <q>the scandal of philosophy</q>:).  By contrast, Descartes' subsequent
attempt to place our knowledge of scientific theories on the same solid,
deductive, foundations as geometry and mathematics (via proofs that God existed
and would not deceive us) was derided as ridiculous by many of his
contemporaries((e.g.  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Schoock|Martin Schook]] in his [[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=dKxa3gAvWR8C|_Admiranda methodus novae philosophiae Renati De Cartes_]].)), and largely dismissed as a second rate addendum by his
successors.

So it remains for many philosophy students today. They often leave their first
year encounter with Cartesian skepticism convinced that the take home message of
philosophy is that no-one _really_ knows anything except their own experiences
and perhaps some mathematics; i.e. truths of which the traditional account of
knowledge remains at least superficially plausible. This insistence upon
rejecting all claims of knowledge that are not justified by the lights of the
traditional view is so common among philosophical novices that Russell bemoaned
it in his [[local:zz.texts/russell1961-basicWritings.pdf|_Theory of Knowledge_]]: <q>... when people begin to philosophize they
seem to think it necessary to make themselves artificially stupid.</q>

Such skepticism is not, however, the starting point of this work. Our knowledge
of scientific claims, such as the charge of electrons, the speed of light in a
vacuum (and its invariance), and that massive objects attract each other with a
force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, is far
better supported than the traditional account of the justification of knowledge.
If that traditional account implies that we do not have such knowledge, then it
is the traditional account itself, rather than the claims to knowledge it
denies, which must be rejected. What we seek is an account of reasoning and
knowledge that is compatible with our having knowledge(:Or whatever positive epistemological state it is held to be, if the term <q>knowledge</q> is reserved for those beliefs justified by the lights of traditional view:) of both
scientific generalisations _and_ principles such as those underpinning deductive
inference.

Our mere possession of knowledge of scientific generalisations does not
immediately discredit the traditional account altogether. It does show that
account to be incomplete  that some knowledge is not justified in the way it
specifies – but it does not show that _no_ knowledge is justified in that way.
The traditional account of knowledge might yet be reconciled with our possession
of knowledge of scientific generalisations by holding that the traditional view
of knowledge is correct within some limited sphere, but that we also possess
knowledge beyond that sphere, where it is not correct.

If the only problem the growth in scientific knowledge posed for the traditional
account of knowledge was our _possession_ of knowledge that was not justified
according to that account, then such reconciliation would be tenable. In
addition to knowledge deduced from first principles known with certainty there
would also be knowledge justified by observation and scientific methods.
However, as our scientific understanding of the physical processes underlying
perception and belief formation developed, it became increasingly apparent that
there was a fundamental conflict between the _content_ of our scientific
knowledge and the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning
_even within its own sphere_.

== second problem: the content of scientific theories ==
The first problem for the traditional Aristotelian account of knowledge was
simply that we _possess_ knowledge that is not justified by the lights of that
account. The second problem is that the _content_ of that knowledge is wildly
incompatible with claims upon which the traditional account of reasoning and
knowledge relied.

St. Thomas Aquinas was probably the original, and certainly the most influential
author of the phrase <q>Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu</q>(([[https://www.corpusthomisticum.org/qdv02.html#51886|_De Veritate_]], Question 2, Article 3 Argument 19, c. 1258.))
(<q>Nothing is in the mind that was not first in the senses.</q>)
but, quite fairly, he attributed the spirit of his precept to Aristotle. It
became a commonplace of medieval scholastic philosophy, discussed by
[[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bonaventure/|Bonaventure]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_of_Aquasparta|Matthew of Aquasparta]], and [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/|Duns Scotus]].  The truth of the dictum
does not directly concern us here, what does concern us is that it makes clear
the traditional commitment to our concepts being the same as the properties
presented in our sensations.  Even Plato, who held our knowledge of the forms to
be memories from a previous life in a divine realm where we had contemplated
those forms directly, also held that the poor sensible copies presented by our
senses in this world were yet close enough to spark our remembrance of their
perfect originals. Of course, philosophers being what they are, these views are
riven by further dispute. St Thomas claimed that the <q>active intellect</q>
which enabled us to grasp the universal properties exemplified in our
sensations, was an aspect of individual human intellects; whereas his
predecessor Ibn Sina held there to be just one active intellect common to all
humans, and St. Augustine considered this one common element to be God's divine
illumination. Grouping all these views under the title of <q>the traditional
account</q> is not intended to deny the profound differences between and amongst
Platonists and Aristotelians, but simply to emphasise that the belief that our
concepts are identical with (or at least similar to) the properties of our
sensations, was an orthodoxy amongst European and Arabic philosophers from
Aristotle up til Descartes.

According to the traditional Aristotelian account, not only were the properties
of our sensations the same as the concepts in our minds, they were also the
properties of the physical objects around us. As Aristotle puts it:
    As we have said, what has the power of sensation is potentially like what
    the perceived object is actually; that is, while at the beginning of the
    process of it being acted upon the two interacting factors are dissimilar,
    at the end the one acted upon is assimilated to the other and is identical
    in quality with it.<br>
    ([[local:zz.texts/aristotle-completeWorks.oxfordRevisedTrans.pdf|_De Anima_]], Book II, §5)

    By a 'sense' is meant what has the power of receiving into itself the
    sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be conceived of as
    taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a
    signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that what produces the
    impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its particular metallic
    constitution makes no difference: in a similar way the sense is affected by
    what is coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent what in
    each case the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has<br>
    ([[local:zz.texts/aristotle-completeWorks.oxfordRevisedTrans.pdf|_De Anima_]], Book II, §12)
The colour of the distant red object is, through the light induced transparency
of the intervening air, able to impress itself on the parts of the eye that are
sensitive to it. As a result of this impressioning process the colour property
present in the sensitive parts of the eye is the very same as the colour of the
distant object.

This triple identity between the concepts by which we think of objects, the
properties realised without matter in our sensations, and the properties
realised by the material objects we perceive and think of, was supposed to
ensure that our concepts _are_ the properties of the objects around us. As 
Aquinas wrote: <q>The intellect, by the very act of understanding, is made one with
the object understood</q>((<q>Nam intellectus, secundum hoc quod actu intelligit, secundum hoc fit unum cum intellecto.</q><br> [[https://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP027.html#FPQ27A2THEP1|_Summa Theologica_]], Part I Question 27 Point 2)) or as Cajetan, a later influential commentator on 
Aquinas put it <q>to know is nothing else than for the intellect to be [the thing
known] and the species is the form whereby it comes to that being</q>((Via Darcy, [[local:zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/darcy1903-aquinasEpistemology.pdf|_Knowledge According to Aquinas_]], 1903)).
Aquinas held this unity between concepts and properties to be the same as that
obtaining between Jesus, who is the word of God, and God the Father, who is the
source of that word. We moderns may wonder at this mystical unity between acts
of cognition and their objects, and scholars continue to debate Aristotle's view
of the relationships between substances, species, forms and universals; but what
is clear, in modern terms, is that the properties possessed by the objects
around us, the properties presented in our immaterial sensations, and the
concepts by which we think of those objects were held to be the same.

Finally, it was because the properties we were manipulating in our imaginations,
memories and intellects were the very same as the properties instantiated by the
material objects around us, that the manipulations we could or could not perform
in thought reflected the combinations of properties that could or could not be
realised in objects outside our minds. Our minds were in direct contact with the
properties of the external world and hence reason, the capacity to abstract
those universal properties from particular instances, could give us insight
into the necessary relationships between those properties.

All of these claims were directly, unequivocally and irrefutably discredited by
scientific discoveries.

==== new understanding of the physiological processes of perception ====
The history of the collapse of the traditional account of knowledge and
reasoning is complicated by the fact that the traditional Aristotelian theories
of sensation and knowledge were not directly replaced by scientific theories
based upon experiment and observation, but were instead swept away by a wave of
wild speculation with only a tenuous connection to empirical evidence
(see {[[timeline-modern_atomism_to_nerve_impulses|timeline: modern atomism to nerve impulses]]}).

At the start of the 17th century Galileo set off a wave of speculative physics
that spread over Europe. However, though Galileo certainly believed a
variety of speculative theories, his most significant discoveries were closely
based on observation and experiment.  His treatise [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidereus_Nuncius|_The Starry Messenger_]] (1610)
contained the first report of observations of heavenly bodies made through a
telescope; and his
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two_New_Sciences&oldid=1166797169#Day_three:_Naturally_accelerated_motion|_Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences_]](:The two new sciences being _statics_ [the strength of unmoving structures] and _kinetics_ [the motion of objects].:) (1638)
contained a quantitative description of the distance travelled by
<q>naturally</q> falling bodies(:i.e. bodies falling solely under the influence of gravity:) (viz., that <q>the spaces traversed were to each
other as the squares of the times</q>(:e.g. a body will fall four times as far in two seconds as it does in one:)&zwj;) and described measurements he had made
of a bronze ball rolling down an inclined plane confirming his claim. His
private notebooks also reveal a wealth of experiments, though these were
downplayed in his published work, where he tended to present his claims as
deducible from first principles. By contrast, the natural philosophers who
followed after Galileo tended to spurn menial laboratory experimentation in
favour of more gentlemanly armchair speculation.

The bodily mechanisms involved in movement and sensation were a particularly
attractive topic of speculation. From the outset Galileo realised that if
mechanistic theories were to be plausible our sensations of colour, taste and
scent would need to be explained as arising from mechanical interactions between
the external bodies and our sensory organs. Indeed this was the main focus of
his 1623 work [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assayer|_The Assayer_]]:
    from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to inhere, these
    tastes, odors, colors, etc., are nothing but empty names; rather they inhere
    only in the sensitive body, such that if one removes the animal, then all
    these qualities are taken away and annihilated.

One speculator was Hobbes. He offered an explicitly mechanistic, albeit
cursory, account of the transmission of sensory signals:
    The cause of Sense is the External Body, or Object, which presseth the
    organ proper to each Sense, .  . . which pressure, by the mediation of
    Nerves, and other strings, and membranes of the body, continued inwards to
    the Brain and Heart<br>
    ([[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Leviathan/The_First_Part&oldid=9608826#Chapter_I:_Of_Sense|_Leviathan_]], Chap. I, 1651)

Descartes was another:
    We must take care not to assume – as our philosophers [namely, the
    Scholastics] commonly do – that in order to perceive the soul must
    contemplate certain images transmitted by objects to the brain; or at any
    rate we must conceive the nature of these images in an entirely different
    manner from that of the philosophers. For since their conception of the
    images is confined to the requirement that they should resemble the objects
    they represent, the philosophers cannot possibly show us how the images can
    be formed by the objects, or how they can be received by the external sense
    organs and transmitted by the nerves to the brain. 
    ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dioptrique&oldid=1184902374|_Optics_]], 1637, §4 via [[local:zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritings.pdf]])

    I would have you consider the light in bodies we call <q>luminous</q> to be
    nothing other than a certain movement, or very rapid and lively action,
    which passes to our eyes through the medium of the air and other transparent
    bodies, just as the movement or resistance of the bodies encountered by a
    blind man passes to his hand by means of his stick. ...
    Hence you will have reason to conclude that there is no need to suppose that
    something material passes from objects to our eyes to make us see colours
    and light, or even that there is something in the objects which resembles
    the ideas or sensations that we have of them.<br>
    (_ibid.,_ §1 via [[local:zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritings.pdf]])

Although the paucity of the evidence upon which Descartes and Hobbes based their
speculations is remarkable (as was their aversion to laboratory work) it is
clear that many people now _know_, what mechanistic natural philosophers such as
Galileo, Descartes and Hobbes may have only _believed_: The surfaces of well lit
middle sized objects such as tables and chairs are radically different to the
streams of particles travelling from those surfaces to our eyes, which are again
radically different to what happens at the backs of our eyes as they are stuck
by those particles, which is again radically different to the impulses sent from
our eyes to parts of the brain, which is again different from the activity in
our brains (and if that gives rise to mental entities or properties such as
sensations or qualia then those are different yet again).

Whether lauded as the best explanations of physiological processes of sensation
and bodily movement available at the time, or derided as restricted to an
implausibly austere range of fundamental interactions too limited to do justice
to either human behaviour or natural phenomena, the theories of mechanistic
natural philosophers eventually led to the empirically well supported
physiological theories of modern science. The empirical successes of those
theories irretrievably shattered the Aristotelian triple identity between
the properties of external objects, our sensations and our concepts, and with it
the illusion that our minds have anything remotely describable as direct contact
with the properties of the objects around us. The loss of that illusion took
with it the traditional account of reasoning that had explained our capacity for
insight into the modal relationships between the properties of the objects
around us.

Unlike the [[#first problem: the justification of scientific theories|first problem]], which merely implied that the traditional account of
knowledge and reasoning was incomplete, the new discoveries concerning the
physiological processes underpinning sensation were outright incompatible with
the traditional account. If the properties of our sensations and thoughts are
not the same as the properties of the objects they represent then the
traditional account of knowledge is false. In particular, the traditional
explanation of the consonance between the properties we can combine <q>in the
intellect</q> and the combinations of properties that external objects can
realise, collapses.

The incompatibility between the new understanding of the physiological processes
underpinning sensation and the ancient account of knowledge and reasoning does
not compel skepticism about our ability to reason. Even if the traditional
account is false and we have no better alternative to offer in its place, that
does not imply that we cannot distinguish good from bad reasoning.  Nor does it
imply that we cannot reason our way to justified beliefs, only that we are
ignorant of how we have these abilities. The lack of a plausible epistemological
theory no more casts doubt on our capacity to reason than ignorance of the
physiology of the eye casts doubt on our ability to see. In both cases, however,
a deeper understanding of the processes involved may improve our abilities by
giving us insight into when they are liable to go wrong and making us less
susceptible to charlatans. But in neither case is the naive account of these
processes beyond question.

There is, however, a yet more fundamental aspect of the conflict between our
understanding of ourselves as creatures whose physiologies obey the same
physical principles as the rest of the natural world, and our understanding of
ourselves as reasoning beings, which does threaten skepticism.

==== insensitive to necessity and possibility ====
With the doubtful exception of quantum mechanics, all the objects described in
our scientific theories are utterly unresponsive to mere possibilities. The
moving bodies postulated in both Newtonian mechanics and general relativity
alter their velocity only in response to actual forces such as occasioned by the
impact of another object, the influence of a magnetic field or of gravitation.
The mere possibility that an object might be struck or the possibility of
magnetic flux has no effect upon such bodies whatsoever.

In reasoning, at least as it has been understood in the European philosophical
tradition since the time of the ancient Greeks till today, we appear to have
access to truths concerning possibility and necessity. Reason reveals to us not
only that each triangle's internal angles sum to two right angles, but that they
must. On the other hand, the merest possibility of rain tomorrow may motivate us
to take an umbrella.  The latter may be explicable as a mere appearance. The
apparent influence of a future possibility may, upon further reflection, be
attributed to the effect of various actual objects and events present and past;
the looming of dark clouds, the weather reporter's confident assertion that it
will rain and so on. In the case of our ability to reason, however, our
sensitivity to modal truths is not so easily dismissed.  An argument is valid
just in case it is impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion
false; and reasoning is supposed, amongst other things, to enable us to
distinguish valid from invalid arguments.

In our reasoning capacities we appear to display a sensitivity to possibility
and necessity that is unlike any of the objects revealed to us by our scientific
enquiries. It thus seems impossible for reasoning beings such as ourselves to be
made from the modally insensitive materials postulated in our best scientific
theories.

== knowledge of necessary truths regarded as the fundamental problem of modern philosophy ==
Initially, it was the [[#first problem: the justification of scientific theories|first of these two problems]] that appeared most pressing
and received the greatest attention from European philosophers.  As awareness
of these problems spread, however, there was an inversion in where the center
of the epistemological difficulties was supposed to lie and the [[#second problem: the content of scientific theories|second problem]]
came to be seen as more critical.

At first the chief difficulty was thought to be our knowledge of contingent
external objects via the senses and it was the nature of the justification of
that knowledge that received the most attention. Descartes' concern was
that the senses are dubious and he sought to show why and under what
circumstances they warranted absolute confidence.  By contrast, he
took our knowledge of truths of mathematics, and of truths underpinning valid
arguments such as his _cogito_ to be indubitable(:Descartes is inconstant on this point. Sometimes he asserts that it is within God's power to deceive us even about such truths.  This even engenders a well known circularity in Descartes' arguments.  But God's power to deceive us about such truths remains an afterthought for Descartes, intended to ensure compatibility with God's omnipotence. By contrast, the main conclusion of the _cogito_ is that we can trust the senses only because the existence of a God who does not deceive us can be _deduced_ from the certain knowledge of one's own existence and thoughts:):
    let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am
    nothing, so long as I continue to think I am something; or make it true at
    some future time that I have never existed, since it is now true that I
    exist; or bring it about that two and three added together are more or less
    than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction.<br>
    ([[local:zz.texts/descartes2-philosophicalWritings.pdf|_Third Meditation_]])
Descartes' attempt to reconcile the traditional account of knowledge with our
knowledge of scientific theories (via God's grace) was never widely accepted.
Instead, eventually, the traditional account of the justification of knowledge
by experience was simply rejected. Though elements of the traditional view
lingered in the shadowy corners of our languages and intuitions, when considered
directly and explicitly, scientific principles were no longer held to be
necessarily true first principles, nor deducible from them, nor known with
certainty.

According to the developing scientific theories, the casual connections
between external objects and our experiences were not necessary, nor did they
simply imprint the properties of external objects onto our sensations.
Nevertheless, it was still accepted that that there were, at least when things
went well, causal chains running from external objects, via experiences, to the
formation of beliefs true of those objects.  Once attempts to tighten the links
in these chains sufficiently to satisfy the traditional account of knowledge
were abandoned, less stringent standards of knowledge were proposed(([[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Nozick&oldid=1172878738#Epistemology|Nozick]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_Williamson&oldid=1166387750#Philosophical_work|Williamson]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duncan_Pritchard&oldid=1036160614#Academic_studies|Pritchard's]] proposals are currently the best known.)) that
could be supported by chains of contingent causation (some with less stringent
standards of necessity to go with them((<q>safety is a sort of local necessity</q> - Williamson, [[https://www.amherstlecture.org/williamson2009/|_Probability and Danger_]], 2009))&zwj;). Of course none of these alternatives
were quite the same as the full strength original, and vigorous discussion of
their various shortcomings continues to this day. Doubtful philosophers
continued, however, to find solace in the causal connections between our
beliefs(:Or at least our assertions.:) and the objects of which those beliefs were true. According to our
best scientific theories, the empirical evidence which justifies our beliefs in
contingent truths (whether that evidence is taken to be other beliefs,
experiences, stimuli, tracks in the sand or noises in the distance) can causally
affect the formation of our beliefs. Hence it seems possible for creatures
displaying roughly our level of success in believing only justified contingent
statements, and assessing the justifications of others' beliefs in contingent
statements, to be constructed from the natural materials described by science.

It was only slowly and reluctantly accepted that our knowledge of contingent
truths (including scientific laws and everyday reports of the world around us)
was not justified in the way specified by the traditional account of knowledge,
and the details of just how our experiences justified such knowledge continued
to be disputed. There did not, however, appear to be a fundamental conflict
between our sensitivity to the justification of contingent statements (and hence
our knowledge of contingent truths) and our scientific understanding of the
world.

By contrast, the incompatibility between our scientific theories and our
apparent knowledge of necessary truths (and capacity for deductive reasoning)
appeared more pressing and less resolvable the more it was considered. Our
capacity to gain knowledge of necessary truths seemed both indispensable to and
incompatible with our scientific discoveries. One difficulty is that many
necessary truths (such as those of arithmetic and perhaps geometry) appear
to refer to objects that are not located in space and time. Objects that are
hence incapable of playing any part in causing the formation of beliefs
about them(:In recent philosophical literature this is sometimes called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Benacerraf&oldid=1172032726#Philosophical_work|Benacerraf's dilemma]] or Benaceraff's epistemological problem.:). Another apparent difficulty is that according to the traditional
view we are, despite our frequent errors in reasoning, justified in believing
some necessary truths with absolute certainty. But any causal psychological
process by which confidence is produced may malfunction.
Hence, though it may produce a _feeling_ of absolute certainty (or at least a
feeling that is customarily described as absolute certainty) no causal
psychological process could ever _justify_ such certainty(:The point is roughly Hume's, though he draws from this claim the conclusion that we can never have any confidence in our judgements at all:<q>In every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well as concerning knowledge, we ought always to correct the first judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the object, by another judgment, deriv’d from the nature of the understanding. ’Tis certain a man of solid sense and long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire; since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and must still dread the like for the future.</q> [[local:zz.texts/hume1739-treatiseHumanNature.pdf|_Treatise of Human Nature_]]:). More generally, as
noted above, the objects described in scientific theories, unlike elements of
the processes by which we hold our beliefs to be formed, appear to be utterly
insensitive to modal relations. As Hume pointed out vigorously and to great
effect, the supposedly necessary connexions between causes and their effects do
not, themselves, have any causal influence on our experiences or beliefs.

The problem is not merely that terms such as <q>knowledge</q> and <q>justification</q>
cannot be translated into the terminology of physics or some other science
(though such a translation would provide a conclusive solution to the
problem).  The term <q>bridge</q> may be untranslatable into the language of
physics(:One problem is vagueness and borderline cases. Is an ant-bridge a bridge?  A tree that falls across a river but rots away without any creature crossing over it? Another is the seemingly infinitely diverse ways in which bridges might be constructed of physical materials [unless there is some maximum size for bridges].:), but the capacity of any particular bridge to bear a load of a
million tons or survive a one-in-a-hundred-years earthquake is explicable in
physical terms. As some 21st century philosophers are wont to say, the
features that make something a useable bridge are _grounded_ by its
physical properties.  There appears to be no such hope of grounding our
sensitivity to modal properties and relations in the physical properties of the
materials from which, according to our current best scientific theories, our
brains and bodies are constructed. Just as it seems impossible to construct a
device for detecting magnetic fields purely from materials utterly unaffected by
magnetism, so too it seems impossible for creatures who are capable of
distinguishing necessary from contingent truths (and valid from invalid
arguments) to be constructed purely from materials utterly unaffected by modal
relationships and properties.

Appearing initially as a felt need for a guarantee of correspondence between
our concepts and the properties they represent(:See the opening paragraph of Descartes' [[local:zz.texts/descartes1-philosophicalWritings.pdf|_The World_]]: <q>The subject I propose to deal with in this treatise is light, and the first point I want to draw to your attention is that there may be a difference between the sensation we have of light (i.e. the idea of light which is formed in our imagination by the mediation of our eyes) and what it is in the objects that produces this sensation within us (i.e. what it is in a flame or the sun that we call by the name 'light'). For although everyone is commonly convinced that the ideas we have in our mind are wholly similar to the objects from which they proceed, nevertheless I cannot see any reason which assures us that this is so. On the contrary, I note many observations which should make us doubt it.</q>:) (the starting point of the
traditional account of our capacity to reason) resolving the conflict between
our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings sensitive to modal
relationships, and the scientific understanding of ourselves as physical systems
constructed from modally insensitive materials, came to be regarded as the
fundamental problem of philosophy.

=== regarded as fundamental by Kantian and Analytic philosophers ===
Largely because attempts to resolve this conflict have repeatedly failed,
many philosophers now doubt that there is any such thing as _the_ fundamental
problem of philosophy. Not only have those attempts failed to re-establish
rational foundations upon which grand philosophical systems might be built
(foundations that were washed away in the collapse of the traditional
account of reasoning) their failure has also cast doubt on the idea of there
being an overarching standard of good reasoning at all. Some philosophers came
to view philosophy as a collection of more or less independent traditions or
projects, each with its own standards for assessing the truth of its
practitioners claims; and no way of judging one project as more central or
fundamental than another.  Even among those those who retained belief in an
overarching standard of reasoning, some believed that difficulties in
distinguishing the necessary consequences of ordinary assertions were so
profound as to raise doubt over whether propositions (_a fortiori_ philosophical
problems) could be cleanly distinguished from one another at all. Even if such
concerns are well founded, however, they are largely foreign to modern
Anglo-European philosophy prior to the second half of the 20th century.

Since Galileo's publication of [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dialogues_Concerning_Two_New_Sciences|_Two New Sciences_]]((The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_New_Sciences|wikipedia article]] on _Two New Sciences_ gives a beautifully informative summary.)) in 1638, only two movements
achieved such dominance over Anglo-European philosophy that they could
reasonably be called orthodoxies. The first was founded by Kant and its members
were those whose views were developments, direct or indirect, of Kant's views –
particularly those expressed in his [[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf|_Critique of Pure Reason_]].  The second was
Analytic philosophy.  There have been times when neither of these
movements dominated Anglo-European philosophy, and individual countries in
which, for a time, other philosophical movements were dominant, but no other
movement has come remotely close to possessing the level of international
influence and popularity held by these two at their heights.

Analytic philosophy's dominance amongst American philosophers in the late
20th century is described unambiguously by John Searl:
    Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States
    are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in
    the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic
    philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the
    analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism,
    existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in
    relation to analytic philosophy.<br>
    (_Contemporary Philosophy in the United States_ in
    [[https://doi.org/10.1111/b.9780631219088.2002.00021.x|_The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy_]]((Note this doi is not properly maintained by Wiley - ISBN: 978-0-631-21908-8)), 2002)
In other English speaking countries Analytic philosophy held much the same
dominance. In continental Europe, however, while there were circles of
highly influential Analytic philosophers, the lingering influence of
Kantianism's various outgrowths prevented Analytic philosophy from achieving the
same dominance.

Analytic philosophy was named by its own members for an at least nominally
shared method of gaining knowledge of necessary truths (viz., analysis(:<q>It seems to me that philosophical investigation, as far as I have experience of it, starts from that curious and unsatisfactory state of mind in which one feels complete certainty without being able to say what one is certain of. The process that results from prolonged attention is just like that of watching an object approaching through a thick fog: at first it is only a vague darkness, but as it approaches articulations appear and one discovers that it is a man or a woman, or a horse or a cow or what not. It seems to me that those who object to analysis would wish us to be content with the initial dark blur. Belief in the above process is my strongest and most unshakable prejudice as regards the methods of philosophical investigation.</q> (Russell, _My Philosophical Development_, 1959. via [[local:zz.texts/russell1961-basicWritings.pdf]]:)&zwj;) and
the unifying claim that analysis was the only means by which ascriptions of
necessity could be justified.  This claim was epitomized in the slogan
<q>All necessary truths are analytic</q>. However, while this slogan commanded
widespread agreement, accounts of what was being analysed and how such analysis
was to be conducted did not. The objects to be analysed were generally held to
be semantic in some sense: concepts, meanings, propositions, sentences, truth
conditions, inferential roles and logical structure were all suggested
candidates. A tremendous variety of theories of meaning were proposed.
Initially these often took the form of attempting to specify how languages fixed
the relationship between symbols and their meanings, but as time went on and
none of these attempts won general acceptance, increasingly sophisticated
accounts of linguistic representation (some of which did not involve the
postulation of meanings at all) were offered. Indeed, producing and criticising
accounts of linguistic representation was one of the movement's major
activities. Still, despite the lack of agreement as to what exactly was being
analysed, members of the movement tended to see themselves as practicing a
distinctively different form of philosophy, and explicitly identify themselves
and their professional institutions as engaging with specifically _Analytic_
philosophy.

Kantianism, by contrast, was named for its founder, and its members tended to
see themselves as engaging with shared ideas rather than as members of a common
movement. Though Kantians celebrated Kant's <q>Copernican revolution</q> they
generally saw themselves as distinguishing the ambitions of traditional
philosophy that could be fulfilled from those that could not, and fulfilling
those that could; as practicing philosophy, informed by Kant's discoveries,
rather than as practicing a new form of philosophy altogether.  Neither Analytic
philosophers nor Kantians regarded the theses proposed by their movements'
founding figures as established truths. Instead, those theses were generally
regarded as promising suggestions.  Suggestions that might, with some
combination of revision and refinement, be developed into true theories.  For
all these reasons, while the boundaries of the membership and doctrines of both
movements are somewhat vague and porous, those of Kantianism are more so.

Kantianism's boundaries may be less clear-cut than those of Analytic philosophy
but its dominance over the European philosophy of its day is not. By the start
of the 19th century, versions of Kant's philosophy were taught in every major
German-speaking university and students flocked to Kant's home town,
K&ouml;nigsberg, which was regarded as a shrine of philosophy. Indeed Kant's
philosophy was so highly regarded that his influence extended beyond the narrow
confines of philosophy and his opinions were sought on public affairs((see Bird, Otto Allen and Duignan, Brian. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant/Last-years . Accessed 19 December 2023.)).
Of course, even during the (first) height of Kantianism's dominance (just after
Kant's death in 1804) European philosophy was noted more for its debates than
its points of widespread agreement, but:
    Remarkably, almost everyone of importance in the debates, apart from the
    parties of metaphysics, faith, and common sense, seemed to profess to be
    philosophizing <q>in the Kantian spirit</q>.<br>
    ([[local:zz.texts/collection2012-cambridgeHistoryPhil19thCentury.pdf|_Cambridge History of Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century_]])
Just as with Analytic philosophy, in its heyday Kantianism was the orthodoxy in
relation to which practitioners of other forms of philosophy had to define their
positions in order to make their work generally accessible to other European
philosophers.

Both Kantianism and Analytic philosophy were based around accounts of our
knowledge of necessary truths. Each movement's founding figures offered
accounts of how knowledge of necessary truths was justified and claimed that
those accounts would, when fully developed, allow us to distinguish good reasoning
from bad and thereby put philosophy on a solid footing. Kant claimed his
account would <q>serve as the touchstone of the value, or lack of value, or all
_a priori_ cognitions</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]], introduction))(:Here, as is usual for him, Kant phrases the problem in terms of _a priori_ knowledge, rather than knowledge of necessary truths. However he held that all and only truths known _a priori_ could be known to be necessarily true: <q>any cognition that is to hold _a priori_ proclaims on its own that it wants to be regarded as absolutely necessary</q> ([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]], Preface A) and <q>if we find a proposition such that in thinking it we think at the same time its necessity, then it is an _a priori_ judgment</q>([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]] , Introduction B). Hence, at least by his standards the questions concerning the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths, and our capacity for _a priori_ judgements are equivalent.:), <q>will make reason secure in its rightful claims and will
dismiss all baseless pretensions</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]], preface A)) and put philosophy <q>on the secure path of a
science</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]], preface B)).  For his part, Bertrand Russell claimed that his new form of
philosophy, in which necessary truths were discovered through a process of <q>logical
analysis, followed by logical synthesis</q>(([[local:zz.texts/russell1918-logicalAtomism.pdf]])), <q>introduced the same kind of advance
into philosophy as Galileo introduced into physics, making it possible at last
to see what kinds of problems may be capable of solution, and what kinds must be
abandoned as beyond human powers</q>(([[local:zz.texts/russell1914-knowledgeOfExternalWorld.pdf]])).  According to Russell this new method of
analysis would enable philosophers to <q>obtain results that do not merely
embody personal idiosyncrasies, but must command the assent of all who are
competent to form an opinion</q>(([[local:zz.texts/russell1914-knowledgeOfExternalWorld.pdf]])).

If it were just the members of these two movements who regarded explaining our
knowledge of necessary truths as the fundamental problem of philosophy, that
alone would be sufficient to warrant the claim that modern Anglo-European
philosophers generally (though of course not universally) regarded this problem
as _the_ fundamental problem of philosophy. But in fact, this view was already
widespread amongst philosophers _prior_ to these movements. Anxieties regarding
the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths predated the rise of
these movements, and it was because they appeared to offer solutions capable of
allaying those anxieties that these movements gained their extraordinary
influence.  (Though of course, as successful salesmen are wont to, the
movements' members promoted the problem to which they thought they had a
solution.)

Each of these two movements grew in popularity while its account of our
knowledge of necessary truths was regarded as plausible, and began to
disintegrate when its account was discredited. In neither case was
this disintegration instantaneous. For a time stylistic and social factors
continued to act as unifying forces; but without a unifying approach to
explaining the foundations of our knowledge of necessary truths, their members'
senses of what constituted good philosophical work drifted apart, and they
gradually fell into a range of factions with less and less in common.

Members of these two movements were some, but by no means all, of the
Anglo-European philosophers who believed that an account of the justification of
our knowledge of necessary truths would provide a touchstone for evaluating
philosophical claims and resolving philosophical
disputes; and that without such a touchstone two <q>awkward facts about
philosophy</q>((This phrase is taken from Chris Daly ([[local:zz.texts/daly2017-persistentPhilosophicalDisagreement.pdf|2016]]) though he does not share the pessimistic outlook it expresses.)) would continue to be true: <q>First, no philosophical problems have
been solved; second, philosophers cannot agree about anything beyond that</q>(([[local:zz.texts/daly2017-persistentPhilosophicalDisagreement.pdf|_ibid_.]])). It
is in this sense that modern Anglo-European philosophers generally came, at
least for a time, to regard providing an account of the justification of our
knowledge of necessary truths as _the_ fundamental problem of philosophy.

== loss of confidence in Analytic accounts of knowledge of necessary truths ==
The latest major development in the long collapse of the traditional
account of knowledge, has been a general loss of confidence in the
central project of Analytic philosophy – viz., to explain our knowledge of
necessary truths in terms of meanings and empirically acquired linguistic
competence, and thereby reconcile our capacity to reason with our scientific
theories. In less than 50 years
the central tenets of Analytic philosophy (such as the doctrine that all
necessary truths are analytic, and that our sensitivity to the
justification of necessary truths can be explained by our empirically justified
knowledge of our statements' meanings) went from being orthodoxies to
being viewed as <q>decidely antique</q>((Soames, [[https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400825790|_Philosophical Analysis in the 20th century_]], 2003)) doctrines, held true by <q>very few
philosophers</q>(([[https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400825790|ibid.,]])).

One of the causes of the rapid decline of Analytic philosophy, was the increased
scope that decline offered for metaphysical speculation. Both Kantian and Analytic
philosophers had denounced the temptations of metaphysical speculation and its
appeal to <q>vanity and convenience</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]])). Of course, they drew the line between
productive philosophy and metaphysical speculation in different ways. According
to Kant we stray into metaphysical speculation when we claim to have knowledge
of things <q>as they are in themselves</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]])) rather than <q>only insofar as they appear
to us</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]])). According to Analytic philosophers we stray into metaphysics when we
claim to have knowledge of necessary truths that are not true purely by virtue
of the linguistic proprieties of the language in which they are expressed. Both
these boundaries were, of course, disputed; as was the question of whether
philosophy (or science) could be done entirely without metaphysical speculation.
But regardless of the coherence of these limits, or how well Kantian and Analytic
philosophers abided by them, the speed and generality with which the central
tenets of Analytic philosophy fell into disrepute was certainly assisted by the
prospect of silencing critics of metaphysical speculation and once again openly
indulging in this traditional philosophical sport.

While the temptation of metaphysical speculation was a _cause_ of the
general loss of confidence in Analytic philosophy (in particular in the
claim that all necessary truths were analytic) the _reasons_ for this loss of
confidence stemmed from two quite distinct problems raised by Analytic
philosophy's critics:

==== justification of analyses ====
The first problem concerned the nature of the evidence for Analytic
philosophers analyses. In [[local:zz.texts/quine1953-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf|_Two Dogmas of Empiricism_]] (1953), one of the most
influential philosophy papers of the twentieth century, Quine alleged that our
epistemic access to the property of analyticity was just as unclear as our
epistemic access to necessity.

Though there was no widespread agreement as to the structure, premises, or even
conclusions of Quine's arguments, Analytic philosophers' continuing inability to
provide a generally accepted account of how to determine whether a sentence of
an unfamiliar language is analytic was more than merely embarrassing.
Difficulties which, up until that point, had been thought to be merely
technical(:The exemplar being the failure of reduction in Carnap's _Aufbau der Welt_.:), came to be suspected of being symptoms of a fundamental problem. In
particular, it was unclear whether Analytic philosophers' claims to reveal
statements' hidden logical/semantic/conceptual structure by analysis of their
meanings, were any more capable of being justified by empirical evidence than
ascriptions of necessity had been in the first place.

==== a posteriori necessities ====
The second problem arose from apparently necessary truths in which belief was
justified _a posteriori_(:With or after the aid of experience:).  Plausible examples of such truths, such as as
<q>Hesperus is Phosphorous</q> and <q>Water is H,,2,,O</q>, were first presented by
Saul Kripke ([[local:zz.texts/kripke1980-namingAndNecessity.pdf|1980]]) and Hilary Putnam ([[local:zz.texts/putnam1975-meaningOfMeaning.pdf|1975]]).
Unlike the truths of geometry, some courses of experience could confirm or
infirm these statements. However, according to their proponents, _if_ these
statements were true then they were necessarily true. If empirical investigation
reveals that water is composed of H,,2,,O then nothing that is not H,,2,,O could
possibly be water. If these statements are indeed necessary truths, they
are counterexamples to the claim that all necessary truths are analytic. As one
commentator put it:
    Kripke's famous conclusion that necessary truths can sometimes be known a
    posteriori and that some contingent truths may be known a priori is
    incompatible with treating statements of necessary truth as disguised
    expressions of linguistic norms which, being products of stipulation, must
    be known a priori.<br>
    (Loomis, [[local:zz.texts/loomis1999-necessityAPrioriStandardMeter.pdf|_Necessity, the A Priori, and the Standard Meter_, 1999]])
Hence the explanation of our knowledge of ascriptions of necessity via
analyticity was at best incomplete, and our knowledge of at least some
necessary truths must be justified by other means.

== three fundamental alternatives ==
From the start of Kantian philosophy's dominance, a variety of its internal
problems were recognised and widely discussed. While various attempts to rectify
those problems were ventured, none ever commanded the same general acceptance as
Kant's views at the height of their influence. There were, of course, also
external challenges to Kantian philosophy's dominance.  Darwin's successful
explanation of the origin of species in entirely natural terms inspired
philosophers as disparate as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer|Spencer]] to offer evolutionary
accounts of human nature, accompanied by dim assessments of the scope and value
of human reasoning. Under the banner of scientific progress, populists such as
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall|John Tyndall]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] championed versions of agnosticism in which they
claimed, somewhat inconsistently, to reject all claims to knowledge of
objects other than those posited in our best scientific theories and (perhaps)
the experiences comprising our evidence for them.

Despite these challenges, however, Kantianism continued to provide an effective
defence of traditional religion, morality and epistemology.  Due in no small
part to the implausibility of the accounts of reasoning offered by the
alternatives, Kantian approaches maintained a clear, though not unwavering,
dominance amongst professional Anglo-European philosophers for over a hundred
years. It was not until technical developments in formal logic improved Analytic
philosophy's prospects that Kantianism was finally displaced.  These technical
developments raised hopes that the statements of natural languages might be
translatable (at least in principle) into a notation in which all and only
necessary truths were expressed by the theorems of a formal logic. This hope
lent plausibility to one of Analytic philosophy's central claims: that the truth
of necessary truths was fixed by adherence to linguistic convention.

Unlike the rejection of Kantian in favour of Analytic approaches to explaining
our knowledge of necessary truths, the loss of confidence in the central
tenets of of Analytic philosophy was not occasioned by the discovery of new
approaches or techniques offering a better prospect of reconciling our
scientific theories with our understanding of our capacity to reason.
Where the final and most decisive loss of confidence in Kantian philosophy had
been due to its displacement by a newly invigorated alternative, the loss of
confidence in Analytic philosophy was (to the delight of the remaining Kantians)
due to its own internal antinomies. In [[local:zz.texts/quine1953-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf|_Two Dogmas of Empiricism_]] (1953)
Quine attacked the analytic-synthetic distinction on the
grounds that it was <q>an unempirical dogma of empiricists</q>.
According to Quine, in taking the distinction between analytic and non-analytic
statements seriously, Analytic philosophers were failing to live up to the
epistemological standards that had driven them to claim that all necessary
truths were analytic in the first place.

The loss of confidence in Analytic philosophy is the most recent phase
of the overall collapse of traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning.
After demolishing the known alternatives, the last and most promising approach
to reconciling our capacity for knowledge of necessary truths with our
scientific theories collapsed under its own weight, leaving no clear alternative
to take its place. One effect of this collapse was that many academic
philosophers simply moved on to other topics. Beating one's head against a
seemingly intractable problem in which all the most plausible leads had been
tried and found wanting was worse than frustrating. In a publish or perish
academic environment it was prudent to move onto other topics where it was
easier to appear to make progress and whose significance was more obvious to
non-philosophers. Furthermore, since the limits that Kantian and Analytic
philosophers had sought to place upon philosophical practice had been
discredited, the range of methods philosophers could employ(:The pre-eminent example being the methods of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_philosophy|experimental philosophy]].:) and topics they
could investigate without their peers dismissing their work as
unphilosophical was wider than ever.

While Kantian and Analytic philosophy had dominated, there had been a broad
consensus that our capacity for reasoning (particularly our ability to gain
knowledge of necessary truths through reasoning) could be reconciled with
naturalism.  The failure of Analytic attempts at reconciliation broke this
consensus and cast doubt on whether such reconciliation could be achieved at
all. Although many philosophers continued to hope for reconciliation, both the
rejection of naturalism and the rejection of the traditional accounts of
knowledge and reasoning gained influential advocates and Anglo-European
philosophy became more fragmented.  In order to trace the collapse of
traditional accounts of knowledge and reasoning through this fragmentation, let
us consider how attitudes to each of these fundamental alternatives changed
in turn: first, the rejection of naturalism; second, the continued pursuit of
reconciliation; and third, the rejection of the traditional accounts of
knowledge and reasoning.

=== first alternative: naturalism is false ===
If naturalism is false, then principles governing the
natural world (fallibly and incompletely described in our empirically justified
scientific theories) are not the only principles that govern our actions and the
formation of our beliefs. The naturalistic constraints that Kantian and Analytic
philosophers aspired to abide by are simply misplaced. Fundamental aspects of
the world have been omitted from our scientific theories, and may be
undiscoverable by scientific methods.  That we have not discovered a way in
which systems composed of the materials thus far discovered by scientific
investigation could reason as we do (or even behave in a way consonant
with being reasoning agents) is not a problem, for we are not systems solely
governed by scientific laws and our observable behaviour is not <q>explicable
according to natural laws</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kant1787-critiqueOfPureReason.pluharTrans.pdf]])). Reason, in particular, may be an unnatural
influence on our actions and beliefs and an extra-empirical source of
substantive knowledge about the necessary structure of the world (much as the
ancient Greeks had thought the study of geometry to be) that has been altogether
omitted from scientific descriptions of the world.

The most obvious (though not the most popular) form of philosophers'
re-engagement with this alternative at the end of the 20th century was a marked
resurgence of interest in Aristotelian metaphysics and epistemology
(particularly in American universities). But an open return to Aristotelian
philosophy was not the only form of re-engagement with this alternative.
More popular approaches to rehabilitating rationalism centered on new
versions of modal realism. The best known of these were developed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)#Realism_about_possible_worlds|David Lewis]]
and [[https://iep.utm.edu/fine-k/|Kit Fine]](:Though Saul Kripke may have been more influential in reviving the investigation of modal logic, his status as a modal realist is less clear-cut.:). According to their accounts, the truth-makers of modal truths are
either other possible worlds just as real as the actual world we inhabit, or at
at least aspects of the actual world which exist independently of our attitudes
towards them. There was, however, no widely accepted account of our epistemic
access to these truths. Our knowledge of them was variously attributed to a raw
intuitive ability to gain insight into <q>the necessary character of reality</q>((BonJour, [[https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511625176|_In Defense of Pure Reason: A Rationalist Account of A Priori Justification_]], 1997)),
an ability to perceive modal relationships akin to either our perception of
physical objects((Bealer, [[local:zz.texts/collection2002-conceivabilityPossibility.pdf]])) or our introspective awareness of our own thoughts, a
sensitivity to the unity and economy of our overall theories(([[local:zz.texts/lewis1986-pluralityOfWorlds.pdf]])) or even to
<q>philosophical analysis</q>(([[local:zz.texts/kripke1980-namingAndNecessity.pdf]])) (albeit in a sense richer than that countenanced
by proponents of Analytic philosophy in its heyday). In any case, our capacity
to reason was once again supposed to give us knowledge of substantive features
of the world which, although completely omitted from our scientific theories,
nonetheless affect (or are at least correlated with) the formation of beliefs
which go on to affect our actions.

In recent times systematic surveys of philosophers' professional opinions have
been taken and their results reflect changing attitudes towards naturalism and
rationalism. The first [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-013-0259-7|PhilPapers survey]] was conducted
in 2009 and [[https://doi.org/10.3998/phimp.2109|the second]] in 2020.  Both surveys were conducted well after the
major loss of confidence in Analytic philosophy's central tenets. By 2006,
influential philosophers were already publishing papers such as
[[local:zz.texts/hacker2006-passingByNaturalisticTurnQuineCulDeSac.pdf|_Passing by the Naturalistic Turn_]] in which the idea that scientific theories
could <q>shed light on the nature of knowledge, its possible extent, its
categorially distinct kinds, its relation to belief and justification</q> was
dismissed as a dead-end or <q>cul-de-sac</q> from which philosophers were
beginning to escape. Despite this, there was still a clear decline in the
percentage of philosophers who accepted naturalism between the two PhilPapers
surveys. In response to the question <q>Metaphilosophy: naturalism or
non-naturalism?</q> the percentage of respondents who indicated that they <q>accept
or lean towards</q> naturalism dropped from 50% to 43%((The survey's authors suggest using their measure of <q>swing</q>, which they define in their report.  The swing against accepting or leaning towards naturalism was 1.71.)).  There was not, however, a
comparable increase in respondents who accepted or leant towards non-naturalism.
Instead, the response to this question which gained the most between the two
surveys was <q>Insufficiently familiar with the issue</q> (from 7% to 12%).  Nor
was there a significant increase in the percentage of respondents who accepted
or leant towards rationalism (only from 28% to 29%).  Instead, the question
<q>Knowledge: empiricism or rationalism?</q> saw an across-the-board increase in
all the variously agnostic responses: <q>The question is too unclear to
answer</q>, <q>There is no fact of the matter</q>, <q>Insufficiently familiar
with the issue</q> and <q>Agnostic/undecided</q>.

Although influential rationalists such as George Bealer declared the start
of the 21st century to be a <q>rationalist renaissance</q>((Bealer, [[https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198250890.001.0001|_Modal Epistemology and the Rationalist Renaissance_]], 2002)), the rejection of
naturalism was not always accompanied by renewed confidence in rationalism. 
More often, naturalism's rejection was accompanied by a vague sense that
the grand projects of Anglo-European philosophy had come to naught, or perhaps
had never been so grand to begin with. If the assumptions underlying their
projects had been correct, then the Kantian or Analytic movements
would have provided a key standard by which to distinguish good from bad
reasoning – but they were not. Not only might those philosophical
movements have been mistaken about the basis of our justification for believing
statements to be necessarily true; they may also have been mistaken about the
importance of providing an account of that justification. Perhaps, in the
end, the justification of our knowledge of necessary truths was not a universal
and fundamental epistemological issue, but merely a parochial concern of a
limited and eventually self-defeating tradition.

In any case, it was widely thought to have been established that Kantian and
Analytic philosophers' attempts to delineate the range of questions that could
be answered by means of pure reason were self-defeating. Their failure to live
up to their own standards had shown those standards to be incoherent, or at
least unachievable; and the limits they had sought to impose on philosophical
practice could once again be flouted unashamedly. Though more commonly relied
upon than explicitly acknowledged, commitment to an unnatural capacity for
discerning necessary truths was no longer considered as disqualifying
philosophical positions from being worthy of further consideration.

=== second alternative: naturalism is true and we have knowledge of necessary truths ===
If naturalism is true and we have knowledge of necessary truths, then creatures
as successful as humans in believing necessary truths just when those beliefs
are justified can be made from purely natural materials (or at least
without the changes in the natural materials from which their bodies are made
diverging from what they would be if they were made from purely natural
materials). As we have seen, finding out how this might be so has been a central
preoccupation of the dominant movements of modern Anglo-European philosophy.

==== perhaps analytic philosophy is true after all ====
One way this alternative could turn out to be true is if some version
of Analytic philosophy were correct.  If analyticity in any given language is a
complex but natural property of sentences, then one can learn to distinguish
analytic sentences as part of learning a language – much as one can learn to
distinguish valid formulae in undergraduate logic classes. Hence if all
necessary truths are analytic then appeals to analyticity may explain how we may
be purely natural causal systems and yet capable of distinguishing necessary
truths.  Such appeals might also explain how our belief in the necessity of such
truths is justified. For analytic sentences must be held true on pain of
linguistic incompetence.  If being justified in believing a statement is a
matter of it being correct or proper to hold that statement to be true, and it
is always proper to do what is required (a principle as certain as ought
implies can) then one is always justified in holding true those statements one
is required to hold true.  If anything roughly along these lines is correct,
then analyticity plays a role in our gaining knowledge of necessary truths
somewhat similar to the role played by experience in our gaining knowledge of
contingent truths. Much as our experiences both justify and (in part) cause our
beliefs in contingent truths, so too analyticity both justifies our beliefs in
necessary truths and is causally connected (perhaps indirectly) with the
formation of those beliefs.

Although the collapse of confidence in Analytic accounts of our knowledge of
necessary truths was precisely a loss of confidence in these sorts of
explanations,
their tremendous popularity prior to this collapse ensured that they retained
many defenders.  The most straightforward manifestation of the continued
defence of Analytic accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths
was a steady stream of academic articles claiming to refute Quine's
allegation that there is no principled way of distinguishing analytic truths.
Some of these putative refutations involved proposing criteria for
distinguishing analytic truths that were supposed to meet Quine's standards
(e.g. [[local:zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/grice1956-inDefenseOfADogma.pdf|Grice, 1956]], [[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2219445|Priest, 1979]], [[https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t0gv3gf5x|Putnam, 1983]] and [[https://doi.org/10.2307/2953775|Katz, 1997]]); others argued
that Quine's standards were too strict ([[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2266637|Kemeny, 1952]]); admitted too narrow a
range of evidence ([[https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2m2f4p1c92|Fodor and Lepore, 1992]]); failed to take normative aspects of
language use into account ([[local:zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/fennell2003-threeQuines.pdf|Fennell, 2003]]) or were unreasonable in demanding that
<q>analytic</q> be reducible to terms of observable verbal behaviour
([[local:zz.texts/soberHylton2000-quinesTwoDogmas.pdf|Sober, 2000]]) or defined in extensional terms ([[local:zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/nimtz2003-analyticTruthsStillHarmless.pdf|Nimtz, 2003]]).  As their
continued production suggests, none of these refutations was widely accepted.
Their net effect was not a regaining of old confidence, but a growing sense of
confused exhaustion. What had once been thought so clear that it might serve as
the touchstone of the value of all necessary judgements was now a mystery.

There wasn't even general agreement at to what Quine's attack on analytic truth
had been.  Some claimed that the Quine's only reason for supposing that
analytic statements could not be distinguished was that past attempts had
failed ([[local:zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/sher1999-isThereAPlaceForPhilosophyInQuinesTheory.pdf|Sher, 1999]]((<q>Quine's 'jump' from the claim that past attempts to establish the distinction faces serious difficulties to the claim that the distinction is (in principle) an untenable dogma is obviously not a step in deductive reasoning</q>))&zwj;), others that his only good argument had been the
<q>historical argument</q> that some truths traditionally held to
be known _a priori_ (most notably the principles of Euclidean geometry) had
turned out to be false ([[https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t0gv3gf5x|Putnam, 1983]]).  Still others held that there was a
principled reason for supposing that the distinction cold not be drawn, but
that it depended upon the doctrine of the indeterminacy of translation which
entailed an <q>unpalatable skepticism about meaning</q> ([[local:zz.texts/zz.referenceOnly/boghossian1996-analyticityReconsidered.pdf|Boghossian, 1996]]).

Despite the lack of any consensus concerning either the structure or value of
Quine's arguments, Analytic accounts of our knowledge of necessary truths
suffered a seemingly terminal loss of popularity: <q>philosophers en masse ...
either joined Quine in repudiating the "analytic/synthetic" distinction or
remained (however mutinously) silent and made no claims of analyticity</q> but
without accepting Quine's <q>radical ...  views on linguistic meaning generally</q>
([[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-3346-3_5|Lycan, 1991]]).  Though some eminent philosophers continued to propose accounts
of analyticity([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brandom|Robert Brandom]] ??? :!5: ) and the value of Quine's criticisms
was still debated, the simple fact remained that after over a century
of trying, no-one had managed to propose a standard of analyticity that was
widely found to be acceptable.

==== perhaps some other reconciliation ====
A vindication of some version of Analytic philosophy is not the only way in
which this second alternative might turn out to be true. If there were some
other natural process that could account for our capacity to distinguish
necessary truths, one which did not especially involve linguistic proprieties,
then naturalism and our possession of knowledge of such truths might be
reconciled in some way that Analytic philosophers had not envisaged.

Kripke's ([[local:zz.texts/kripke1980-namingAndNecessity.pdf|1980]]) and Putnam's ([[local:zz.texts/putnam1975-meaningOfMeaning.pdf|1975]]) discovery of necessary truths in
which belief was justified _a posteriori_ seemed to open up just this
possibility.  If we have knowledge of _a posteriori_ necessities then there must
be some way in which knowledge of substantive necessary truths, truths which
might be questioned or rejected by competent language users (and hence were not
analytic) might be justified by observation. Perhaps the doctrine, commonly held
by both Kantian and Analytic philosophers, that belief in necessary truths can
only be justified by pure reason, was false. Hopes were raised that rejecting
this restriction might open up an approach to reconciling naturalism with our
possession of knowledge of necessary truths that Analytic and Kantian
philosophers had mistakenly excluded. These hopes did not, however, survive
closer inspection of these _a posteriori_ necessities.

===== Kripke necessities =====
The most widely accepted examples of _a posteriori_ necessities presented by
Kripke ([[local:zz.texts/kripke1980-namingAndNecessity.pdf|1980]]) were all identity statements, and each was deduced via an
instance of the following argument schema:
	  | (P1) | ∀x,y (x=y => ☐ x=y) |
	  | (P2) | a=b                 |
	  | (C)  | ☐ a=b               |
The premise (P1), which warrants the inference from empirically confirmed
identity statements to claims that such identities obtain necessarily, was
itself supposed to be necessarily true and known _a priori_. (P2) was a
contingent identity statement in which belief was justified, at least in part,
by experience and observation (e.g. <q>Winona Ryder is Winona Horowitz</q>). The
conclusion derived from these two premises was thus both a true ascription of
necessity and justified, in part, by observation.

Kripke offered at least two justifications for (P1). The first was that (P1)
could be deduced from the claim that all objects are necessarily self-identical
(<q>∀x ☐(x=x)</q>) and the principle of the indiscernability of identicals
(<q>∀x,y(x=y =>. F(x) => F(y)&zwj;)</q>(:In the relevant instance of this schema the open formula in place of <q>F(...)</q> is: <q>☐( ... = x)</q>:)&zwj;).
The second was that (P1) could have no counterexamples, for:
    What pairs could be counterexamples?  Not pairs of distinct objects,
    for then the antecedent is false; nor any pair of an object and itself, for
    then the consequent is true.<br>
    (Kripke, [[local:zz.texts/kripke1980-namingAndNecessity.pdf|_Naming and Necessity_]], 1980)
While these justifications swayed many, they were not an explanation of our
capacity to distinguish necessary truths (nor intended as such). Kripke took the
principles from which (P1) could be derived to be such obvious first-principles
that he did not attempt to present any justification for them:
    Already when I worked on modal logic it had seemed to me, as Wiggins has
    said, that the Leibnitzian principle of the indiscernibility of identicals
    was as self evident as the law of contradiction. That some philosophers
    could have doubted it always seemed to me bizarre.<br>
    ([[local:zz.texts/kripke1980-namingAndNecessity.pdf|_ibid._]], 1980)
The question of how a purely natural system might discern such <q>self evident</q>
truths was simply not addressed.

===== Putnam necessities =====
Like Kripke's _a posteriori_ necessities, the _a posteriori_ necessities
Putnam presented were inferred from a combination of necessary truths known
_a priori_ and contingent truths discovered by empirical investigation. The
most widely repeated of Putnam's _a posteriori_ necessities was <q>Water is
H,,2,,O</q>. This supposed necessity was derived from the _a posteriori_
scientific discovery that water <q>around here</q> is more or less dilute
mixtures of various chemicals with H,,2,,O; and the _a priori_
necessary principle that:
    "water" is stuff that bears a certain similarity relation to the water
    around here. Water at another time or in another place or even in another
    possible world has to bear the relation same,,L,,(:i.e. same_Liquid:) to
    our "water" in order to be water.<br>
    (Putnam, [[local:zz.texts/putnam1975-meaningOfMeaning.pdf|<cite>The meaning of <q>meaning</q></cite>]], 1975)
Putnam justified this _a priori_ principle, by _analysis_ of the term
<q>water</q>.  Putnam claimed, quite convincingly, that <q>water</q> was a
natural kind term, and <q>the predominant sense of natural kind words</q> was
one in which they were true of <q>whatever things share the nature that things
satisfying the description [potable, thirst quenching, transparent etc.,]
normally possess</q>. Sharing a nature was a matter of having the same 
<q>hidden structure</q>(:<q>To sum up: if there is a hidden structure, then generally it determines what it is to be a member of the natural kind, not only in the actual world, but in all possible worlds.</q> ([[local:zz.texts/putnam1975-meaningOfMeaning.pdf]]) :), and in the case of liquids such as water
this hidden structure was _chemical_ structure.  In other words, the statement
<q>All water bears the relationship same,,L,, to the water around here.</q> was
_analytic_ – true by virtue of the meanings of the terms it contained. (Most
saliently, though not solely, the meaning of the term <q>water</q>.)
Anyone using the term <q>water</q> (in its <q>predominant sense</q>)
must hold  <q> ... is water</q> to be true of any substance they believe (or are
willing to assert) to be the same kind of liquid as <q>the water around here</q>
on pain of linguistic impropriety.
 
===== _a posteriori_ necessities neither undermine analytic accounts of knowledge of necessary truths nor suggest an alternative =====
Neither Putnam's nor Kripke's _a posteriori_ necessities provide grounds for
doubting that appeals to analyticity can explain our knowledge of necessary
truths in naturalistic terms, nor for believing that there is some other way in
which our knowledge of necessary truths could be justified.  Analytic
philosophers had appealed to analyticity to explain our capacity to distinguish
necessary truths because they had supposed that analyticity was a natural
property capable of causally affecting the formation of beliefs and all and only
necessary truths were analytic. Although Putnam's and Kripke's _a posteriori_
necessities were decisive counter examples to the Analytic claim that all
necessary truths were analytic, they did not undermine the capacity of such
appeals to explain our knowledge of necessary truths.

Both sorts of _a posteriori_ necessities were deduced from necessarily true
principles known _a priori_. Putnam's from the principle <q>All water
necessarily bears the relationship same,,L,, to water around here</q>.  Kripke's
from the principle <q>All objects are necessarily identical to themselves</q>.
Putnam held his principle to be analytic – a claim that competent speakers could
tell was true by virtue of their capacity to tell true semantic analyses from
false.  Kripke held his to be a metaphysically necessary truth
independent of language that reason enables us to recognise as true by
contemplating it.  However, many Analytic philosophers happily held the
principle of self-identity to be analytic – holding that to deny any objects
self-identity was to use the term <q>identical</q> improperly.  Rather than
exemplifying an alternative justification of our knowledge of necessary truths,
our knowledge of these _a posteriori_ necessities is dependent upon our
knowledge of the _a priori_ necessities from which they are deduced; and there
is no reason to suppose that our knowledge of the particular _a priori_ truths
from which these _a posteriori_ truths are deduced is any less explicable by
appeals to analyticity than our knowledge of any other _a priori_ necessary
truths.

Furthermore, if appeals to analyticity explain our knowledge of both
_a priori_ necessities and valid arguments, then they also explain our knowledge of
these _a posteriori_ necessities. Each of Putnam's and Kripke's _a posteriori_
necessities is deduced by a valid argument from two premises: a necessary truth
known _a priori_ and a contingent truth known _a posteriori_. In the case of
<q>Water is necessarily H,,2,,O</q> these two premises are  <q>All water
necessarily bears the relationship same,,L,, to water around here,</q> and
<q>Water around here is H,,2,,O</q>.  If purely natural systems can recognise
and be justified in believing analytic truths, and the _a priori_ necessary
truths serving as premises in these arguments are analytic, then purely natural
systems can recognise and be justified in believing them.  So too, if each valid
argument has a corresponding analytic conditional (as to any argument of the
form <q>P therefore Q</q> there is a corresponding instance of the sentence
schema <q>If P then Q</q>) then purely natural systems can recognise valid
arguments and be justified in believing that they preserve truth. The only gap
left in the justification of our knowledge of the conclusions of these arguments
concerns their contingent _a posteriori_ premises. As discussed above, our
knowledge of such truths appears not to present (as insurmountable) a problem
for naturalism since there are, when things go well, causal chains from the
objects that make those beliefs true to the formation of the beliefs about them
via the empirical evidence for those beliefs.

Despite providing no additional reason to believe that we have knowledge of
necessary truths that cannot be explained by appeals to analyticity, nor any
suggestion of an alternative way in which our knowledge of necessary truths
might be justified, Kripke's and Putnam's _a posteriori_ necessities had two
major effects on philosophers' attitudes towards our knowledge of necessary
truths.  The first was to license rationalism and metaphysical speculation (e.g.
:!5: [!citations required!]). The second was to make the crisis created by the
ongoing inability to provide a satisfactory account of analyticity seem less
pressing. It was easy to feel that if some necessary truths were not analytic
then there must be some other way in which our knowledge of necessary truths
could be justified. Although this feeling did not stand up to close scrutiny, it
often persisted when it wasn't directly considered (as is the case in much
metaphysical speculation where the chief interest is usually the topic of
speculation).

==== second alternative: summary ====
At the beginning of the 21st century the prospect of finding a reconciliation
between naturalism and our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings was
more remote than it had been for two hundred years. Confidence in Analytic
philosophers' claim that knowledge of necessary truths could be gained by means
of philosophical/conceptual/logical/linguistic analysis had collapsed for want
of any widely accepted theory of meaning in which the distinction between
correct and incorrect conceptual/semantic/logical/linguistic analyses could be
delineated; and there was a growing sense that these failures were not
due to superable technical difficulties, but to fundamental misconceptions
concerning language and linguistic representation.

Instead of providing inspiration for alternative accounts of our knowledge of
necessary truths, _a posteriori_ necessities allowed the problem of reconciling
naturalism with our knowledge of necessary truths to be de-prioritized. The
dispute between Kantians and Analytic philosophers as to how knowledge of
necessary truths was justified could be put aside as <q>the usual
empiricism/Kantianism oscillation</q>(([[local:zz.texts/putnam1975-meaningOfMeaning.pdf]])). An old dispute,
leading nowhere and based upon Hume's dichotomy between <q>relations of
ideas</q> (necessary and known _a priori_) and <q>matters of fact</q>
(contingent and known _a posteriori_). A dichotomy to which _a posteriori_
necessities were decisive counter-examples.

For the first time in over two hundred years, no approach to explaining our
knowledge of necessary truths compatible with naturalism was widely considered
to be promising. What made the prospects of reconciliation even worse, was that
enthusiasm for seeking such a reconciliation was also at a low ebb.  Rather than
being viewed as the central problem of philosophy, the conflict between our
scientific theories and our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings had
come to be viewed as just another unsolvable philosophical problem
(see [[local:zz.texts/yablo1993-isConceivabilityAGuideToPossibility.pdf|Yablo, 1993]](:The <q>grand-scale objection</q> that naturalism is incompatible with our sensitivity to modal truths <q>require[s] answers.  But answers of a kind that the experience of philosophy hass accustomed us to doing without.</q>:), [!citations desired!]). The situation had come to resemble a
conversation that had gone on too long. The topic had become tedious for want of
any meaningful progress, and participants started to forget how it had begun and
why it had seemed important in the first place.

Worn out by repeated failures, without promising leads, and under unrelenting
pressure to publish novel results, many philosophers simply downgraded the
importance of the problem and talked about other things.  Disengagement
with the question was so notable that some began to ask <q>Why aren’t there many
philosophers pursuing modal epistemology for its own sake?</q>((Fisher & Leon, [[local:zz.texts/collection2016-modalEpistemologyAfterRationalism.pdf|_Introduction to Modal Epistemology after Rationalism_]], 2017)).  Where once the
problem of our knowledge of necessary truths had been viewed as the central
problem of philosophy, now <q>most came to the topic [of modal epistemology]
from metaphysics or the philosophy of mind</q>(([[local:zz.texts/collection2016-modalEpistemologyAfterRationalism.pdf|ibid.,]])).

As both Kantian and Analytic philosophers had claimed they would, attempts to
resolve other issues continued to hinge upon claims to knowledge of necessary
truths, and philosophers were driven back into considering how to evaluate such
claims. For example, at the turn of the 21st century the <q>hard problem of
consciousness</q>((see Chalmers, [[https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof%3Aoso%2F9780195311105.003.0001|_Facing up to the Problem of Consciousness_]], 1995)) had become a prominent debate in the philosophical literature.
In that debate, the key premise of the most influential argument for the claim
that states of consciousness could not be identified by their causal/functional
roles (hence making the hard problem of consciousness hard) was that 
[[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2023/entries/zombies/|philosophical zombies]] are conceivable. The argument's key inference was from
this premise to the claim that philosophical zombies were possible, and hence
that creatures possessing structures playing all the relevant causal
roles might yet lack consciousness. The problem of our access to
knowledge to necessary truths thus commonly arose in the philosophical
literature of the time in the form of attempts to establish why conceivability
was a reliable guide to possibility (see [[https://doi.org/10.2307/2108052|Yablo, 1993]], [[https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1017159501073|van Inwagen, 1998]],
[[https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00377.x|Kung, 2010]], [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-010-9520-5|Hawke, 2011]]).  In this way and others, investigation into the
justification of our knowledge of necessary truths persisted, but primarily as
a tool for resolving other more specific debates.  Unlike the earlier efforts of
Analytic and Kantian philosophers to provide a comprehensive account of our
knowledge of necessary truths, at the turn of the century engagement with this
problem was more cautious, shaped by past failures and framed in terms of its
applications to other specific problems rather than as a standalone
epistemological concern.

By the early 21st century, the net effect of a hundred years of Analytic
philosophy had been to recreate the mazed confusion concerning the basis of our
knowledge of necessary truths that the early titans of Analytic philosophy had
confidently claimed to be on the brink of resolving.  While the hope that
naturalism might be reconciled with our understanding of ourselves as reasoning
beings had not been completely extinguished, after four hundred years of trying
the only consensus was that nothing tried so far had worked, and increasingly
many were inclined to simply give up, avoiding the problem where they could, and
living with the mystery where they could not.  As a
young philosopher put it in their 2020 Doctoral thesis: <q>Well, I don’t know
how causal entities such as brains grasp abstract entities [such as numbers and
concepts] but we simply do and we can model that phenomenon!</q>(([[local:zz.texts/matze-Concepts.pdf]])).

=== third alternative: modal skepticism ===
If we do not have any knowledge of necessary truths then the traditional account
of knowledge and reasoning is false. Our capacity to reason does not involve the
ability to distinguish between necessary and contingent truths and Aristotle's
claim that the best form of knowledge involves being aware <q>that it is not
possible for [the thing known] to be otherwise</q>(([[local:zz.texts/aristotle-completeWorks.oxfordRevisedTrans.pdf|_Posterior Analytics_]], Book I, §2)) is also false.
Just as the distinction between phlogistinated and dephlogistinated materials is
part of a false explanation of combustion, the distinction between necessary
and contingent statements is part of a false explanation of our capacity to
reason.  People can, more or less reliably and consistently, distinguish between
statements traditionally labeled as necessary and contingent; but the diagnosis
of those statements as necessary and contingent is a misdiagnosis of some other
natural (and causally efficacious) difference between them.

This third alternative has never been popular, but it is not entirely novel.
Before the rise of Kantian philosophy, both Mill and Hume, though the latter
inconstantly, were among its eminent advocates. (And their views foundered, in
large part, because of the implausibly impoverished accounts of reasoning they
offered.) Since the loss of confidence in Analytic accounts of our knowledge of
necessary truths, however, the only influential modal skeptic has been Quine.

Just as there was little agreement as to the structure or premises of Quine's
arguments against the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, so
too there was little agreement as to the structure or premises of his arguments
against the distinction between necessary and contingent truths.  However,
whereas his attacks on the analytic-synthetic distinction led at least two
generations of Anglo-American philosophers to treat claims of analyticity with
suspicion, his attacks on modal language did not persuade any other influential
philosophers to avoid claims of necessity.  The contrast between the impact of
Quine's attacks on analyticity and his attacks upon necessity is made all the
more striking by the fact that Quine himself held <q>analytic truth</q> and <q>necessary
truth</q> to be inter-definable (at least in their application to whole
statements) and equally unacceptable((see §3 of [[local:zz.texts/quine1953-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf|_Two Dogmas_]])).
Despite this, and at least partly motivated by their frustration with the
strictures of Analytic philosophy and their enthusiasm to re-engage in
metaphysical speculation, philosophers accepted Quine’s attacks on analyticity
while rejecting his attacks on necessity.

Quine distinguished carefully between using <q>necessarily</q> as a predicate, as in:
    Necessarily 'All objects are identical to themselves'.
or as an operator, as in:
    All objects are necessarily identical to themselves.
In the latter statement the term <q>necessary</q> occurs between the quantifier
(<q>All</q>) and the term it binds (<q>themselves</q>). (Notably, it is from such
statements that Kripke's and Putnam's _a posteriori_ necessities are deduced.)
Quine claimed that such shifts in the use of <q>necessarily</q> (or its cognates)
marked the difference between taking necessity to be, like analyticity, a
property of linguistic representations, and taking it to be a metaphysical
property possessed by objects regardless of how (or if) they are represented.
Using his expertise in formal logic Quine was able to skewer those who had
confused these different uses((see [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20114402|_Reply to Professor Marcus_, 1961]])), including founding figures of Analytic
philosophy such as Russell.

Though Quine's criticisms helped stimulate a marked increase in the technical
sophistication of modal logic, they failed to convince any other influential
philosophers to follow him in rejecting modal language altogether. At best,
Quine's arguments were taken as reductions to absurdity – the absurd conclusion
that there was no distinction between necessary and contingent truths revealing
only that one or other of his premises must be false. (The two most popular
false premise candidates were behaviourism and extensionalism.)  More commonly,
his arguments were simply regarded as exposing one or more gaps in our current
understanding of modality – gaps that further investigation might yet fill.

At the end of the 20th century, modal skepticism was well known as
a central doctrine of one of the twentieth century's most influential
philosophers, but it was accepted by no-one else.  Other late
twentieth century philosophers, most notably van Inwagen ([[https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1017159501073|1998]]), offered
so-called <q>moderate</q> forms of modal skepticism, but none apart from Quine
advocated for the complete elimination of all talk of necessity and possibility
from our best theories of the world. In this Quine was entirely alone.

== this work ==
The chief purpose of this work is to advocate a specific version of the third
alternative: modal skepticism. According to the view urged here, the traditional
Aristotelian account of reasoning is a false explanatory theory, of which the
supposition that there is a distinction between necessary and contingent truths
is a tenacious remnant. This theory is unusually intertwined with our norms of
giving and accepting reasons, our practices of taking each other's assertions to
be justified or unjustified, and even our introspective diagnoses of our own
mental states – all of which has made it particularly resistant to correction.
In the end, however, as with other explanatory theories, our belief in it is
justified by its successes in predicting and explaining observable phenomena. In
this case, successes such as predicting which sentences people hold to be
necessary or contingent and which chains of reasoning they find compelling; and
(as presented in the [[meno|_Meno_]]) explaining why untutored novice geometers can
recognise some geometrical claims to be true merely by contemplating them, why
we can deduce truths of geometry, mathematics and logic by _a priori_ reasoning,
and why, in general, reasoning tends to lead from truth to truth.

In this work, an alternative explanatory theory of reasoning is proposed – one
intended to provide a better explanation of our capacity to reason. Better, not
merely because it explains the same phenomena as the traditional account
in a way compatible with naturalism and without reliance upon a
discredited theory of perception (though these are significant virtues) but
also because it explains other related phenomena that the traditional
account fails to explain. Why reasoning led so many brilliant thinkers to
falsely believe that the geometry of physical space was Euclidean for so long;
why _a priori_ reasoning is so productive of knowledge in the fields of
mathematics (particularly geometry) and logic and yet so unproductive in
philosophy; why philosophers are often so dogmatic – convinced that those
who disagree with them have made an error in their reasoning despite
persistent disagreements with peers who they hold to be their epistemic equals.

In a sense, the ultimate objective of this work is to complete the collapse of
the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning. This ambition is, of course,
overweening. In many ways, the traditional account of reasoning is the founding
myth of European philosophy, and its tenacious hold on the inheritors of that
tradition will not be broken by a single work of an obscure philosopher. Nor
will this work mark even the beginning of the end of the collapse, for that
distinction rightfully belongs to Quine's rejection of the analytic-synthetic
distinction. Hopefully, however, this work takes a further step toward the
completion of this collapse. For by freeing ourselves from these ancient
falsehoods, we may finally achieve what the traditional accounts of knowledge
and reasoning once offered to the ancient Greek philosophers who sought to
explain the success of geometry: a reconciliation between our understanding of
the world around us and our understanding of ourselves as reasoning beings.

==== bibliographical note ====
One of the more egregious defects in the above text is its
repeated reference to <q>the traditional account of knowledge</q> without an
adequate scholarly defence of the claim that there was _a_ traditional account
of knowledge. Certainly nuances, such as the fact that in the _Timaeus_ and the
_Theatetus_ Plato offers an account of perception as the product of interactions
between external objects and elements of an observer's body or soul, are omitted.
(However, Plato goes on to deny that perception is a source of knowledge for
precisely this reason. And when, in the [[meno|_Meno_]] and elsewhere((Plato's theory of anamnesis also features in _Phaedo_ and _Phaedrus_ and is hinted at in the allegory of the cave in book VII of the _Republic_.)), he does explain
the basis of our knowledge of the forms it is because in the divine realm in
which we lived before we were born we did perceive the forms directly and they
were imprinted on our minds. Plato’s account thus still makes knowledge
dependent on the direct imprinting of properties in the mind via perception,
however that perception is supposed to have taken place before birth.)

In this work, however, revisiting the extant scholarly literature on the topic
seemed unproductive. (Much as repackaging dubious home loans into ETFs does
little to improve their overall value, repackaging the existing scholarly
literature here would add little value – though in this case, the underlying
goods are doubtless of higher quality.) Readers interested in the scholarly
literature concerning the prevalence of resemblance theories of perception may
wish to start by looking at Ben-Yami's excellent book
[[local:zz.texts/benYami2015-descartesPhilosophicalRevolution.pdf|_Descartes' Philosophical Revolution_]] in which he beautifully outlines
the almost universal acceptance of resemblance theories of perception (and
associated accounts of knowledge of necessary truths) among European
philosophers in the era preceding Descartes.
