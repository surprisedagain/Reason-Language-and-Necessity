== Early modern philosophers correctly identified the problem  ==
Modal skeptics may hold a far more positive view of modern philosophy.  They can
agree with the mainstream opinion of early modern philosophers (shared by
major figures as disparate as Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley and Kant)

discoveries and the traditional account of reasoning (according to which reason
gives us knowledge of necessary truths).

In particular Hume and Kant were both right in believing

understanding our capacity to reason.

== Analytic philosophers correct that only appeals to meaning could explain ==

Finally, modal skeptics can agree with Analytic philosophers that
our knowledge of necessary truths can only be explained by appeal to our
knowledge of the meanings of linguistic expressions.

The analytics were right that the explanation in terms of linguistic conventions
was the only way in which the reconciliation could be achieved. 

It is easy, now, in the wake of the disintegrating Analytic project to
cast doubt on whether there ever was , whether the category of Analytic
philosophy has any useful role to play in the taxonomy of philosophy.

Analytic philosopher's were also right, the breakthrough's in formal logic that
underpinned 
the brink of delivering an account of analyticity that would explain the
justification of our knowledge of necessary truths, when in fact they were not,
was that they had correctly identified this as the only way in which such
reconciliation could be achieved.

Once we understand the reasons why Analytic philosophy offered the greatest

capacity to reason and discern the justification for necessary truths, and then
understand the reasons why this

inexplicable intuitive capacity that are throwing away the last three hundred

taken as an irreducibly (and ungroundable) fundamental aspect of the world.

If, however, the critics of the notion of analyticity are right, and there

it is we learn when we learn a language, and this best and most optimistic
alternative is ruled out, then

~~REVIEW THEM FOR~~ [[initial_objections]] !!!!

== Earlier modal skeptics ==
Comte glossed over the 
Although they rejected Kant's account of our
knowledge of necessary truths they had nothing to put in its place. In his
[[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#CouPosFriMil|_Course of Positive Philosophy_]] (1830-42) Comte had claimed that
mathematics was the science of distance measurement and like other sciences
its truths concerned contingent regularities in our sensations. J.S. Mill
approached the problem more explicitly, denying that the truths of mathematics
were necessary, and claiming that universal claims (such as <q>All men are
mortal</q> or <q>Each triangles angles sum to two right angles</q>) were mere
reminders of a justified commitment to making real inferences from past
particular observations

Attempts were made to avoid this problem. J.S. Mill, for instance, denied that
the truths of mathematics were necessary at all. Holding instead that held that
all <q>real</q> inferences were from particulars to particulars, and that
universal claims (e.g. <q>All men are mortal</q> or <q>All triangles have
internal angles that sum to 180 degrees</q>) were mere reminders of our
justified commitment to making such inferences (e.g. inferring from particular
past observations of humans dying that a particular newly observed human will
also die).


== falsehood does not imply scepticism ==
~~this may go in~~ [[initial_objections]] ?
Just as the falsehood of the theory of perception upon which the traditional
account of knowledge and reasoning relied does not imply that we cannot
perceive; the falsehood of the traditional account of knowledge and reasoning
does not imply that we cannot know or reason, 

the falsehood of the claim that there
are necessary and contingent truths (and unaided reason can only justify
knowledge of the former) does not imply that we do not have knowledge or cannot
reason

However, where the traditional theory of perception involved claims concerning
the processes by which the properties of external objects were transmitted to our
minds via our sensory organs. Claims which were comparatively easily
refuted by empirical investigation of the physical processes involved
in perception.

By contrast, the claim that we are are capable of distinguishing
necessary truths draws its chief support from its explanation of our
introspective awareness of our own thought processes.  Its credibility is
largely due to the explanation it offers of the introspectively felt difference
between statements such as <q>All widows have been married.</q> and <q>All
widows are near the Earth.</q>. The immediacy of the introspective awareness of
a distinction between these two types of statement, and its direct connection to
the diagnosis of necessity/contingency gives this diagnosis an
unwarranted credibility. This has made this last lingering element of the
traditional account of knowledge and reasoning particularly resistant to
correction (see {[[introspection_not_a_source_of_theoretical_knowledge]]}).
However, while an alternative account of our capacity to reason does need to
explain what it is about these sentences that we are responding to, it does not
need to take the diagnosis of sensitivity to necessity/contingency at face
value, and questioning that diagnosis need not plunge us into skepticism.

In fact this might be a nice way to conclude that section
It is true that this differs from early modern

It is tempting, to suggest that the principles of reasoning are
bedrock. That no further justification is required. But what we are seeking is
not justification.

== not a search for justification ==
One way to make this vivid is by pointing out. nother way is to say that when we
try to conceive of such a system we fail. But as noted the properties of our
perceptions, thoughts and beliefs . For those who present the
problem this way the issue is how do we manage to go astray. How do we manage to
make mistakes or hold false beliefs that can be corrected by reasoning in the
first place.

bearing in mind also that this sense of transparent obviousness led our best
minds for centuries to falsely believe that the geometry of the world must be
Euclidean.

= What counts as knowledge? What counts as reasoning? =
Someone who has completed a modern day university arts degree, or otherwise
engaged with almost any of the academic humanities as currently practised, may
naturally suspect that any enquiry into the nature of knowledge and reasoning
must begin by defining its terms, and that those definitions will largely
pre-determine what account we eventually arrive at concerning them.  That, to
put it in its crudest form, "It all depends on what you mean by 'knowledge' and
'reasoning'".  This view however, is itself a remnant of the ancient view
outlined above, according to which the only way to arrive at knowledge is by
starting with certain principles (reflecting either the essential properties of
objects or our definitions or perhaps both) and then derive consequences from
them. The fact that such approaches are still often regarded as the pre-eminent
method of conducting an intellectual investigation is both a sign of how the
ancient view lingers on in the humanities departments of academia, and how
bankrupt those departments have (often) become.

The approach followed here is more akin to an investigation into a new and
only partly understood observed phenomena.  Rather than starting with
definitions we shall begin with exemplars and search for any underlying
principles that might explain or unite them. 

Like the ancients Geometry, the giving of proofs concerning the relative length
of lines, closed figures consisting of such lines and the size of circles and
angles. The proof by which each of us is genuinely convinced that the area of
the square based upon the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the
sum of the reason of the squares based on its other two sides (and not merely
brow beaten into acquiescing with this claim). The argument Socrates presents to
the slave boy in the Meno oldest exemplar of this kind of reasoning (in any
tradition
These must all count as reasoning, and the
claims issued must in some sense count as true.

Or, if the question of how reasoning justifies our beliefs is too entwined with
we must at least explain why the products of reasoning are so successful, and
why outside of these narrow sphere's, in the fields of 

Whatever is going in these exemplars had better count as reasoning.

The attitude I am proposing to follow can be couched as a form of humility. If
our philosophical account of reasoning implies that any of the cases above are
not instances of reasoning, or that they do not lead us to gain justified true
beliefs about the world or that those beliefs are not knowledge; then it is more
likely that our account of knowledge and reasoning is wrong rather than those
cases not being knowledge. Rather than collapsing into scepticism if the account
of reasoning we uncover does not fit our preconceptions, let us take our success
in producing knowledge in geometry, mathematics, science and everyday life as
more certain than any philosopher's crazy theory.

This view explains why we seem unable to imagine situations in which these
principles are false. Why these principles are, in fact observed to be true.
(e.g. why we never observe
principles discovered, and why these principles are in fact true.


if we do not have a sense of modal relations between our beliefs (or perhaps the
situations they represent) then we cannot make sense of the making an error in
our reasoning, nor otherwise distinguish good reasoning from bad (apart perhaps
from the fact that the former is more likely to lead to false conclusions, and
even that tendency is inexplicable.
